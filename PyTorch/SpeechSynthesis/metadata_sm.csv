audio-0.300-1.500|From behind my seat.
audio-1.300-5.500|I unloaded a grocery bag of chips and hamburger buns while he open the hatch.
audio-5.300-9.800|He wore long Madras shorts in a pine green polo shirt.
audio-9.600-13.700|And as I watched his movements the quick effortless way.
audio-13.500-15.500|He lifted the beer laid in cooler.
audio-15.300-20.700|I thought about how that easy strength of his it thrilled me once and how it didn't anymore.
audio-20.500-29.500|Hey, I looked up and there were rooster and stew striding down the Rocky Hill that divided the parking lot from the beach.
audio-30.300-32.800|Hey to you my called back.
audio-32.600-36.100|He cast me watch will glance and I put on a smile.
audio-36.800-43.700|Coming into the shade rooster pulled off his sunglasses and wiped his arm across his forehead the Sun and gotten to him already.
audio-43.500-47.000|His freckles cheeks were paying his nose a shade or two darker.
audio-46.800-53.400|It's perfect Eason warm little breeze and we got the pier.
audio-53.200-54.200|No problem.
audio-54.000-55.600|Great.
audio-55.400-61.000|Mike said You lock the car, and we headed for the helm who is Dusty already.
audio-60.800-68.100|It has been a dry spring and patches of Scruffy grass brushed against my ankles as I climbed at the top.
audio-67.900-74.300|I posed to look down at Jamie waving from the pier at the sweep of dazzling Blue Pine ter.
audio-75.000-89.400|I started toward the beach on the pier Bill and Christine sat side-by-side apparently together again their hips and thighs touching those hand rusting Loosely on Christine's knee falling like across the sand.
audio-89.200-95.300|I wanted nothing more than to sit like that with him until I remembered that was what I didn't want.
audio-96.200-100.900|Smooth I was in I had to remind myself if it's rules sometimes.
audio-102.100-109.300|Rooster had already started the fire and soon Jamie and Christine and I won wrapping the raw burgers and laying them out on a paper plate.
audio-109.100-115.700|Jamie was right beside me and in a quiet voice, she said What's up?
audio-116.600-119.100|I Shrugged my thing.
audio-119.800-121.500|She looked at me carefully.
audio-122.700-130.800|really nothing after we ate I took a second beer from a cooler and sat at the end of the pier to Ken was icy.
audio-130.600-140.500|Almost painful to hold but I held it anyway my feet just skimming the water which I noticed was lower than usual was not supposed to come up to my knees.
audio-140.300-145.600|I thought so, but I didn't think so very strongly and I know I didn't say so.
audio-146.400-147.400|Next thing.
audio-147.200-151.200|I knew Mike was standing over me casting a shadow on to me in the water.
audio-151.000-154.300|He prodded me once with this big tone announced.
audio-154.100-156.000|I'm going swimming.
audio-157.100-162.100|I could feel everyone looking at me roosters to Bill Christine.
audio-161.900-167.500|Even Jamie looking and thinking come on Carrie get the guy to break.
audio-168.400-174.600|I turned and looked at a strong hairy legs then up at his face, which was dark against the bright Sun.
audio-175.200-182.000|Heat strip to his swimming trunks and as he stood there waiting for me to say something rooster came over to stand beside him.
audio-182.700-191.100|Getting a little spare tire their bunny rooster said he copped Mike lightly migrant makes two of us, huh?
audio-190.900-194.800|Maybe we should start a diet Club the spare tire Spartans.
audio-194.600-197.100|What do you say they all left?
audio-196.900-206.800|The Spartans have been our high school mascot that we were a year out of college and still making Spartans joke seem to me to be a symptom of whatever it was.
audio-206.600-211.700|We all had whatever disease was that had us doing the exact same things.
audio-211.500-215.100|We'd always done and with the exact same people.
audio-215.800-223.300|I think I'll wait till after the holidays rooster said the holidays are six months away exactly.
audio-224.600-226.100|Now Mike looked at me.
audio-225.900-229.800|So what do you think you said should I die?
audio-230.700-232.000|Why don't you just jump?
audio-233.000-236.300|Later, I clung to that is evidence that I tried to stop him.
audio-236.100-237.900|But in fact, I was just being contrary.
audio-239.000-242.800|Dive rooster said definitely dive.
audio-243.600-246.800|Mike took off his baseball cap and held it out for me to take.
audio-247.500-249.100|What about your sunglasses?
audio-248.900-252.000|I said you dropped the cap on to the pier.
audio-251.800-253.700|They're coming.
audio-253.500-255.600|He said on a joyride.
audio-255.400-266.500|He looked at rooster and Sue and Bill with an endearing expression of amusement and Challenge on his face and for an intense moment then watching him with his friends.
audio-266.300-271.900|I long to feel again what I no longer felt that he was just what I wanted.
audio-272.700-274.000|You guys are wimps.
audio-273.800-278.500|He said I'll think of you when I hit that cool refreshing water.
audio-279.200-282.300|Everyone laughed again was Memorial Day.
audio-282.100-283.700|The water was freezing.
audio-284.600-292.500|Then somewhere on a reservoir a motorboat started up and we were still for a moment as we looked across the water to see if we could see it.
audio-293.100-300.700|I remember the sound so clearly the sound of the boat and also the feel of the icy cold beer can in my hand.
audio-301.500-311.600|I wish I'd done something to stop him then jumped up and said I'd marry him that day or burst into tears or held on tight with leg anything.
audio-312.300-314.000|But of course I didn't.
audio-314.600-318.500|I was already looking away one from across the water.
audio-318.300-321.600|There came the sound of the outboard revving higher.
audio-322.500-333.700|and then Mike Toth when something terrible happens to someone else people often use the word unbearable.
audio-334.600-340.700|Living through a child's death a spouse's in during some of their kind of permanent loss.
audio-340.500-341.700|It's unbearable.
audio-341.500-354.400|It's too awful to be born and the person or people to whom it's happened take on a kind of horrible glow in your mind because they are in fact bearing it or trying to doing the thing that it's impossible to do.
audio-355.400-368.800|The glow can be blinding at first it can be all you see and although it diminishes as years past that never goes out entirely so that late some night when you're wandering the back Pathways of your mind.
audio-368.600-374.800|You may stop at the sudden sight of someone up ahead signaling even now with the same but terrible light.
audio-375.600-391.200|Mike's accident happened to Mike not to me, but for a long time after what I felt some of that glow thought I was giving it off so that even doing the most innocuous Aaron filling my car with gas for buying toothpaste.
audio-391.000-395.800|I thought everyone around me must see I was in the middle of a crisis.
audio-396.700-398.000|Did I didn't cry?
audio-399.000-408.000|The first days at the hospital were full of crying Mike's parents crying his brother and sister and rooster maybe rooster most of all.
audio-408.700-418.100|Travis dry-eyed my mother and Jamie told me it was because I was numb and I guess that was part of it numb and terrified.
audio-418.800-425.500|When I looked at him, it was a few years had Unwound and I just met him and I couldn't stand not knowing what was going to happen.
audio-426.600-428.500|But there was something else too.
audio-429.400-434.600|Everyone was treating me so carefully and solicitously that I felt breakable.
audio-435.300-437.000|And yet I wasn't broken.
audio-438.000-444.500|Mike was broken and I wasn't broken he was separate for me and that was shocking.
audio-445.700-446.800|He was in a coma.
audio-447.800-455.400|Thanks for the combination of drought and a newly Bank of Shoreline the water and causing his Reservoir had been 3 feet lower than usual.
audio-455.200-459.500|If he woke up it would be to learn that he'd broken his neck.
audio-460.500-474.300|But he didn't wake up days went by and then it was a week 10 days and he was still unconscious lying in intensive care in a tiny room crowded with machines more than I ever would have imagined.
audio-475.100-493.500|He was in traction his shaven head held by tongues attached to weights and because he had to be turned onto his stomach every few hours to avoid bed sores his bed was a two-part contraption that allowed for this a pair of giant ironing board shape things that could sandwich him and flip him.
audio-494.300-505.100|Visiting hours were 3 p.m. To 8 p.m. 10 minutes per hour two people at a time, but it seemed we no sooner get in to see him in the nurses would ask us to leave.
audio-504.900-510.600|It was as if merely body now he belong to them.
audio-511.800-513.300|Near the nursing station.
audio-513.100-519.600|There was a small lounge and that's where we mostly were talking or not talking looking at each other or not.
audio-519.400-519.900|Looking.
audio-520.800-525.900|There would be five of us or 10 or 20 a core group of family and close friends.
audio-525.700-529.400|Plus Mike's co-workers stopping by after the Bank closed.
audio-529.200-533.700|The mayor's neighbors checking in my mother arrived in with bags of sandwiches.
audio-534.900-542.600|The two-week Mark came and when I woke that morning, I thought of something one of the doctors has said early on that each week.
audio-542.400-549.900|He was unconscious the prognosis got worse unresponsive was the word they used whenever I heard it.
audio-549.700-564.800|I thought of myself in the car on the way to clawson's Reservoir not answering his questions 2 weeks was only one day more than 13 days, but I felt we turned a corner that shouldn't have been turned and I couldn't get myself out of bed.
audio-565.800-567.300|He had to wake up.
audio-567.100-571.200|He had to I couldn't stand to think of what a bitch.
audio-571.000-573.700|I've been a cozzens reservoir with a bitch.
audio-573.500-576.900|I'll spring it was like a horrible equation.
audio-576.700-581.600|My bitchiness plus his fear of losing me equaled Mike in a coma.
audio-581.400-587.800|I knew as clearly as I knew anything that I driven him to dive to impress me.
audio-587.600-597.500|I squeeze my eyes shut and try to remember when everything between us have been fine, February January Christmas.
audio-598.400-599.700|It was June now.
audio-599.500-607.800|I had the day off work and it lasts I got up and made coffee then started laying out the pattern for an off-white linen jacket.
audio-607.600-620.700|I've been planning to make first Iron in the crumpled tissue and then moving pieces around on the length of fabric until I was satisfied I pin them and cut them out with my Fiskars and went back into the notches sniff by snip.
audio-620.500-625.400|I chopped the pattern marks on to the fabric and by late morning.
audio-625.200-635.500|I was sitting at my Bernina sewing machine winding a bobbin in trance by the fast were of it by the knowledge that for hours now, I'd be at the machine my foot on the pedal.
audio-636.500-644.600|I've been sewing for 11 years since my first home at class in junior high when I made an a-line skirt and falling in love.
audio-645.600-655.300|It was the inexorability of it that appealed to me how a length of fabric became a group of cut out pieces that gradually took on the shape of a garment.
audio-655.100-657.800|I loved everything about it.
audio-657.600-665.800|Even a little snip threads to be gathered and thrown away the smell of an overheated iron to scatter of pins at the end of the day.
audio-666.600-671.400|I loved how I got better and better closer and closer with each thing.
audio-671.200-673.300|I made to achieving just but I'd hoped.
audio-674.100-678.600|When the phone rang at 8:30 that evening the sound woke me from the work.
audio-678.400-680.500|It was mrs. Mayor.
audio-680.300-688.500|She asked how I was told me she'd heard it might rain and then cleared her throat and said she'd appreciate it if I'd stop by the next day.
audio-691.000-696.500|Good Morning Sun slanted down the sidewalk aiming my shadow in the direction of Lake Mendota.
audio-696.300-702.100|Mike loved Lake Mendota the way the city hugs its curves.
audio-701.900-723.200|He like to pull people into debating the relative merits of it and Lake Monona Madison other Big Lake Erie life a list of ways that Mendota was Superior as if it were a team he supported my car was already hot to the touch and I unlocked it and roll down the windows seats scorched my legs.
audio-723.900-730.200|At the hospital I felt mrs. Mayor watching me and watching me waiting for me to break down.
audio-730.000-734.200|What is the molecular shape of Mike's house came into view a little later.
audio-734.000-740.000|She was watching again standing at the living room window with the curtain on the side as if she'd heard.
audio-739.800-741.800|I was on my way but didn't believe it.
audio-741.600-743.600|I got out of my car.
audio-743.400-754.300|The house was big and white a perfectly symmetrical Colonial with black shuttered windows and an iron eagle on the black front door.
audio-755.000-759.800|I hadn't been over since the accident, but the yard was as tidy as ever.
audio-760.500-762.300|Mrs. Mayor open the door.
audio-762.100-764.600|She said with a smile.
audio-764.400-765.800|I'm glad you're here.
audio-766.700-768.500|I tried to smile back.
audio-769.200-774.500|At the hospital and has been hard to look at her wrecked face, but this was almost worse.
audio-774.300-779.100|She was pale and drained as if she finally run out of Tears.
audio-780.100-782.300|What's going to the kitchen show me dear?
audio-782.900-792.100|I followed her through the large old rooms pass couches were Mike and I and sat together tables where I casually piled my school books.
audio-791.900-794.600|He was my house too in a way.
audio-795.600-803.000|When we got to the kitchen mrs. Mayor made tea sitting down opposite me she blew on hers and then cleared her throat.
audio-804.000-805.200|Are you going today?
audio-806.000-807.500|I picked up my cup.
audio-807.300-821.100|I thought about trying to explain about yesterday about the two-week marker about how I reaching up when it's scared me, but I knew she was aware of it too and scared too and that she'd gone anyway.
audio-821.800-826.500|I blew on my team took a sip the lemon and its heart and satisfying.
audio-827.200-832.200|having visitors means a lot to him I met her glance then looked away.
audio-833.100-834.900|Nothing meant anything to him.
audio-834.700-846.300|That was the problem the tragedy that in the fact that the area between his 5th and 6th vertebrae had suffered an injury that could leave him paralyzed for Life quadriplegic.
audio-846.900-854.400|Thinking that way though that my visiting would mean nothing made me feel churlish a dweller on the bedside.
audio-855.100-862.800|Carrie she was staring at me for still young Face line with concern when I spoke.
audio-862.600-864.400|I sounded distant even to myself.
audio-865.400-868.600|I said I have to work, but I'll go afterward.
audio-869.400-873.500|She noted then reached across the table and took hold of my left hand.
audio-874.200-877.000|She touched the tiny diamonds on my ring finger.
audio-877.900-883.200|Michael was so happy the day he bought this it was like something he'd made it school.
audio-883.000-883.900|He was so proud.
audio-884.900-898.700|Julie made a remark about how it wasn't that big or something and his face just fell he got that hangdog look on his face and he said to me do you think Ariel like it she like oh my hand.
audio-899.500-901.200|Do you think area like it?
audio-901.800-903.800|He loves you very much, dear.
audio-904.600-906.000|I looked away from her.
audio-906.700-907.500|I know.
audio-908.800-910.900|We drink our tea silently.
audio-911.700-920.600|After while I told her I wanted to go up to his room and I climb the stairs and turn down the hall going past framed photographs of all three mayor kids.
audio-921.200-924.400|I just or I hesitated then went in.
audio-925.200-927.700|There was a must-see on used now.
audio-928.500-934.400|I crossed the bed and sat down running my fingers up and down the room to Blue bedspread.
audio-935.200-937.000|On his bedside table.
audio-936.800-942.000|There was a picture of me from high school graduation, and I picked it up and looked at it.
audio-941.800-948.600|It was a familiar picture, but the girl and it seems only tenuously connected to who I was now.
audio-949.800-952.500|She looks sure of herself sure.
audio-952.300-956.600|She stay on Mike's bedside table for years and years and be happy about it.
audio-957.300-962.400|My cat never left home and is room for traces of all the different stages of him.
audio-962.200-973.800|I've known trophies next to text books next to the briefcase here to begun carrying the year before when he started working at a job in new accounts at a bank near the capital.
audio-973.600-980.900|And as I looked around I thought of how we've been talking lately and finally moving out saying that since he was making good money.
audio-980.700-984.200|He should get an apartment teach himself domestic life.
audio-984.000-986.200|So you wouldn't sabotage our marriage.
audio-987.000-991.200|Three or four times it said it and I'd never responded.
audio-991.900-1001.900|It killed me to think of it now my trolling for something just good idea or no better keep saving your money.
audio-1002.800-1007.200|And how I gave him nothing not even a wedding date.
audio-1007.000-1009.600|I deflected that question 2.
audio-1010.400-1017.200|Later, I kept thinking next year or the year after I tried not to think about it at all.
audio-1019.700-1028.300|I worked at the University Library where I had a work-study job while I was a student when I graduated they offered me 35 hours a week.
audio-1028.100-1032.700|And so I stayed on I could take or leave the job.
audio-1032.500-1039.800|But I like being on campus walking to the union on brakes heading up State Street to Window Shop.
audio-1041.100-1048.400|My job was in the rare books room where the only staff member close to my age was a graduate student named Victor from Poland.
audio-1048.200-1052.200|He was at the desk when I arrived and I could tell right away.
audio-1052.000-1055.300|He was in a good mood caddy caddy.
audio-1055.100-1056.300|Come here.
audio-1057.100-1060.300|He motioned me over with a boisterous wave his arm.
audio-1061.000-1065.500|Although he was sitting and I was standing he seemed to loom over me.
audio-1065.300-1068.900|He was without doubt the biggest person.
audio-1068.700-1074.700|I'd ever known 6-6 with broad beefy shoulders thick slab of a torso.
audio-1074.500-1077.500|He said this morning.
audio-1077.300-1082.600|I am telling Anya that we must be more social in Slavic studies.
audio-1082.400-1097.200|We have parties, but they are too Slavic you can come for dinner when Dinner at Victor's this was a first and I wondered how much it had to do with Mike's being in the hospital and whether or not given that Mike was in the hospital.
audio-1097.000-1106.700|I should go I was about to make an excuse when a door at the back of the room opened and then meet Prim head of our boss Miss Grafton poked out.
audio-1106.500-1107.900|Oops.
audio-1107.700-1115.600|I said quietly but Victor put on a big smile and wave Jean yelling at her and after a moment her head with Drew and she closed the door.
audio-1115.400-1118.100|She loves me.
audio-1117.900-1127.000|He said matter-of-factly his voice only a little lower now, I am tall strong good-looking.
audio-1126.800-1143.800|She sees me and thinks of the agony of her dry sex with life, but she is happy for a moment because I remind her of one that wasn't so I laughed Mike loved my Victor stories and I thought of how funny he thinks.
audio-1143.600-1146.000|This one was then remembered.
audio-1145.800-1153.200|I couldn't tell him a feeling of something heavy moved through me like sand falling through water.
audio-1153.000-1154.800|I looked away.
audio-1154.600-1158.200|Let's say a week from Saturday.
audio-1158.000-1161.100|If they're said you're cooking.
audio-1160.900-1165.000|Tex-Mex onion is a fabulous cook, you know, I don't know.
audio-1164.800-1167.100|I'm not that I don't know.
audio-1166.900-1169.000|He said yes.
audio-1168.800-1169.200|Yes.
audio-1169.000-1171.200|Okay.
audio-1171.000-1171.300|Yes.
audio-1172.300-1176.800|He smiled triumphantly deep lines appearing in his stumbling cheeks.
audio-1176.600-1179.300|He was 28 but looked older.
audio-1180.000-1185.800|I moved away ready to get to work and he called my name Victor.
audio-1185.600-1190.300|I said wearily miss grafton's going to I am just giving you a message.
audio-1190.100-1200.100|He handed me a piece of paper and I walked a few Paces away and slip between a pair of tall bookcases and his big blocky capitals.
audio-1199.900-1207.400|It said Jamie 10:30 10 take lunch anytime between 12 and 3.
audio-1207.200-1212.900|If you call by 11:45, please call says hi.
audio-1213.700-1216.300|Sorry, I folded the note and put it in my pocket.
audio-1216.100-1219.600|Jamie worked in a coffee shop three blocks away.
audio-1219.400-1224.600|And we sometimes met for lunch after hours were right the past few months.
audio-1224.400-1229.000|I'd mostly been telling her they warrant that I've been given a late lunch or none at all.
audio-1228.800-1238.200|But recently since the accident she been pushing it leaving messages like this one calling at work just to say okay.
audio-1238.000-1244.800|I knew she was worried about me and I felt grateful for that or if not grateful at least touched.
audio-1244.600-1251.600|I looked at my watch 11:35 at the very least I should call to say.
audio-1251.400-1255.600|No, but it would be so much easier not to call to pretend.
audio-1255.400-1256.900|I hadn't gotten the message in time.
audio-1257.800-1262.200|Since the accident I could get away with more which scared me.
audio-1264.400-1275.000|The hospital was like a city with distinct neighborhoods in commercial areas and quarters inside like long longstreet's when I arrive that evening.
audio-1274.800-1280.100|I sat in one of the lobbies for a few minutes trying to get myself ready to go up.
audio-1279.900-1286.700|I happened to glance at the revolving doors and there was rooster coming in still in his suit.
audio-1286.500-1288.600|I stood up immediately.
audio-1289.500-1298.400|He was like mrs. Mayor full of Hope and I knew he disapprove of my just sitting there of anything that smells of pessimism.
audio-1298.200-1302.800|I crossed the lobby and met him near the information desk.
audio-1302.600-1313.300|He looked at me oddly for just a moment after we said hi, and I wondered if he knew about my absence the day before it's mrs. Mayor and told him.
audio-1314.000-1319.200|We rode the elevator up to intensive care bear was always quiet and a little Tim.
audio-1319.900-1326.200|Several nurses sad inside the central workstation speaking in low voices are going over charts.
audio-1326.000-1343.500|When was standing in the hallway and when rooster stopped to talk to her I stopped to She was 29 or 30 blond beautiful in an icy Nordic way impossible in other words, which was just his type.
audio-1343.300-1348.100|I stood behind him smiling little whenever she looked my way.
audio-1349.000-1353.400|Nurses knew who each of us was rooster was the best friend.
audio-1353.200-1355.600|I was the fiance.
audio-1356.700-1361.200|Mike was on his back and I relaxed a little at the sight of him.
audio-1361.000-1370.000|It wasn't any harder to season it has been two days ago a completely familiar body now minister to buy machines.
audio-1369.800-1377.700|The only thing covering him was a small cloth draped over his crotch and the rest of them look pale and Joey.
audio-1378.500-1382.100|Hi, Mike, rooster send it's me, bud.
audio-1381.900-1383.800|I'm here with Carrie.
audio-1383.600-1398.000|He looked at me and waited and lifted his chin a bit to urge me to speak the nurses and doctors have encouraged us to talk to Mike, but it made me feel uncomfortable as if I were speaking into a tape recorder.
audio-1397.800-1405.900|I stayed silent its June 14th rooster continued after a moment 7:20 p.m.
audio-1405.700-1408.600|I came straight from work to see you bud.
audio-1409.400-1413.700|I took a few steps closer with rooster out of my vision.
audio-1413.500-1416.500|It was possible to imagine Mike and I were alone.
audio-1416.300-1421.400|I didn't want to speak out loud, but that didn't mean I couldn't talk to him.
audio-1422.200-1424.900|I covered his hand with mine and told him not to worry.
audio-1425.900-1426.900|I'm here.
audio-1426.700-1429.500|I told him I'm here.
audio-1429.300-1429.900|I'm here.
audio-1431.100-1432.700|Later at the elevators.
audio-1432.500-1436.300|We ran into Mike's family making their nightly trip back in to tell him.
audio-1436.100-1436.600|Goodnight.
audio-1436.400-1465.600|Mrs. Mayor was plainly relieved to see me and even Mister mayor look to me for an extra moment and not as of talking way for future analysis the knowledge that I was here now, but hadn't been last night rooster said he had to go but I felt I should stay I headed back to the land with them and waited while to buy to they visited Mike's room than the five of us were all in the lounge together and although there was no reason to stay none of us made a move to leave.
audio-1466.300-1468.100|Have you seen the doctor's today?
audio-1467.900-1471.100|I looked up and found Julie watching me.
audio-1470.900-1474.600|She was 19 and just home from a first-year college.
audio-1474.400-1476.300|I shook my head.
audio-1476.100-1478.200|I mean it mom.
audio-1478.000-1485.500|She said we can just sit around on our asses and expect them to keep us completely up-to-date live to be active participants.
audio-1485.300-1488.900|This is Mayor cast me a sad smile.
audio-1488.700-1495.600|Cheese's Julie cried and she got up and ran from the lounge to hear.
audio-1495.400-1501.300|This is Mayor said, I'll go mr. Mayor said, but he didn't move.
audio-1502.200-1504.100|I glanced John junior.
audio-1503.900-1509.000|He was 16 and heartbreaking with wavy brown hair and grey eyes.
audio-1508.800-1516.500|Mike's hair and eyes and the exact body my cat had 6 years earlier muscular, but still there all wasted.
audio-1516.300-1518.600|How are you John?
audio-1518.400-1521.000|I said fine.
audio-1520.800-1523.100|His voice was husky.
audio-1522.900-1525.200|I thought he was trying not to cry.
audio-1526.100-1529.900|I looked at mr. Mayor at is 10 balding him.
audio-1529.700-1548.900|How does hazel eyes feel me behind the classes in becoming a cereal and a speech since the accident one day delivering sermons about Hope and patience and the next lecturing us on the spinal cord and its function I liked him, but I couldn't listen made me too jittery.
audio-1549.900-1552.400|I guess I better go I said.
audio-1553.200-1557.900|Three of them said goodbye and I felt them watch me as I left the lounge.
audio-1558.800-1561.900|I wondered how long they'd sit there before they went home.
audio-1563.000-1570.200|Brewster was still in the lobby when I got there standing near the exit talking to the same blond nurse.
audio-1571.000-1574.900|After a moment, he looked up and saw me then motioned for me to join them.
audio-1575.600-1580.200|Have you guys actually meant he said carry, this is Joan.
audio-1580.000-1582.700|She's from Oconomowoc believe it or not.
audio-1583.500-1587.000|I nodded his parents were both from Oconomowoc.
audio-1586.800-1589.700|It was where he went for holidays.
audio-1590.400-1591.900|You don't carry is.
audio-1592.800-1594.200|Trump smiled at me.
audio-1594.000-1603.300|She was taller than I'd realized nearly 6 ft with clear fair-skinned and extraordinary pale blue eyes.
audio-1604.400-1606.100|I'm sure sorry about Mike.
audio-1605.900-1608.800|She said thanks.
audio-1608.600-1611.800|It's way too soon to give up hope though.
audio-1612.600-1623.400|exactly rooster sin John headed for the exit and I watch rooster watching her his eyes on her, even when she was out the door and heading into the parking lot.
audio-1624.500-1626.800|Nice, he said it last.
audio-1627.600-1628.800|Nice one.
audio-1628.600-1630.500|I was used to his ways.
audio-1630.300-1632.500|Nice legs.
audio-1632.300-1633.000|Nice ass.
audio-1634.100-1635.100|Just nice.
audio-1636.000-1640.600|He put his hand on my shoulder and after a moment, we started toward the door together.
audio-1641.600-1642.900|Let's go for a drink.
audio-1643.700-1651.700|I glanced up and found him watching me closely face flushed red hair damp the hairline eye looks away.
audio-1652.700-1654.100|I really feel like it.
audio-1655.000-1657.500|He stops walking and put his hands on his hips.
audio-1657.300-1659.000|Come on.
audio-1658.800-1660.900|Carrie be a friend for once.
audio-1660.700-1664.900|Okay, one beer, I promise and go somewhere quiet.
audio-1665.700-1668.900|For once why did you say for once?
audio-1669.600-1675.300|My eyes burned a little and I thought it would be incredible if this was what finally made me cry.
audio-1676.100-1677.400|I didn't mean it like that.
audio-1678.500-1684.400|aside rooster always got his way eventually through sheer force of will.
audio-1685.100-1686.000|All right.
audio-1685.800-1688.000|I said one beer.
audio-1689.700-1696.700|We drove separately than men up in front of the university book storm while we were standing there trying to decide where to go.
audio-1696.500-1698.100|We ran into stew.
audio-1697.900-1704.000|We talked to since Dean and Terrace Brewster stood in line for beer wants to and I got a table outside.
audio-1705.100-1711.600|Lake Mendota was a ripple in silver like a vast piece of silk spread out but not yet smooth.
audio-1712.600-1719.400|Rooster arrived with the beer I reach for my mug and took a sip stooling forward.
audio-1719.200-1721.100|How are you doing?
audio-1722.100-1725.200|I looked at my hands off the table and rocked it back and forth.
audio-1726.100-1731.300|And the mayor's lousy Brewster said like all of us.
audio-1732.200-1733.600|He glanced at me.
audio-1733.400-1737.200|Is that a fleeting moment of thinking he was accusing me of something?
audio-1738.300-1740.900|Strong I'm worried about I said.
audio-1741.700-1745.300|John and mr. Rooster friend.
audio-1745.100-1749.800|I don't think Julie is that hot either I miss his marital my mom.
audio-1749.600-1752.400|She hasn't slept more than an hour to time since it happened.
audio-1753.200-1756.300|I just meant John seems especially vulnerable.
audio-1757.400-1761.200|Sounds tough rooster sound like monkey.
audio-1762.200-1765.600|I thought of Mike on the pier completely hyped up to dive into water.
audio-1765.400-1768.400|He knew would be freezing tough.
audio-1768.200-1771.400|I said that turned out to be good quality.
audio-1772.300-1783.200|Restaurants to stared at me in shock a tiny Breeze blew in from the lake and a paper napkin lifted from our table flipped over once and settled again.
audio-1783.900-1788.000|I felt odd skin on my upper cheeks tingling a little.
audio-1788.800-1789.800|Take it back.
audio-1789.600-1792.000|I thought I couldn't.
audio-1792.900-1795.900|I looked at my hands aware of roosters glare on me.
audio-1797.000-1805.700|I can't believe you he said and he said his mug on the table with a loud thud he scraped his chair back and stood up.
audio-1805.500-1809.700|I'm out of here and he said to Stew I don't need this shit right now.
audio-1809.500-1810.100|See you later.
audio-1811.200-1813.500|I looked up in time to watch him walk away.
audio-1814.300-1815.800|I turn back to Stew.
audio-1816.700-1819.600|Sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me.
audio-1820.500-1822.200|Steaua staring at the lake.
audio-1822.000-1824.400|His hands wrapped around his beer.
audio-1825.200-1827.600|What are you thinking I said?
audio-1828.400-1829.800|He smiled uneasily.
audio-1830.700-1838.100|I was thinking about that weird stuff actually about me and Mike and rooster walking to picnic point on the ice that time.
audio-1839.000-1840.100|I stared at him.
audio-1840.800-1842.000|What are you talking about?
audio-1843.000-1847.900|inner designs Mike never told you Tell me what?
audio-1849.000-1850.400|Still took a sip of beer.
audio-1851.300-1852.800|It was freshman year of college.
audio-1852.600-1854.100|I was at Marquette.
audio-1853.900-1857.900|It was Christmas vacation and I drove home and called the rooster.
audio-1857.700-1862.300|He called Mike and the three of us came down here or so goes.
audio-1862.100-1863.900|Let's walk out to picnic point.
audio-1863.700-1875.300|It was 15 degrees out but all of a sudden all three of us were trooping outside like he was the best idea we ever heard of we went down to the lake and it had been a warm fall.
audio-1875.100-1879.000|It was hardly Frozen but rooster started walking out on the ice.
audio-1878.800-1887.600|I said some Mike I don't even go round mykos be tough tough is one thing and that is another right.
audio-1887.400-1896.200|I said fuck know you guys will kill yourselves like gives me this look like well, let's hope not but if we do we do and he goes out on the ice.
audio-1896.000-1898.100|So what was I going to do?
audio-1897.900-1900.400|I follow right after them.
audio-1900.200-1907.200|We walked the whole way there and back without saying a word and it was the next day that that kid fell through the ice up in Sawyer County.
audio-1907.000-1912.700|Remember he was in the water for like half an hour while his friend ran for help and stuff.
audio-1912.500-1920.000|I remember I remember It's been a little boy may be 8 by the time they got back to him was too late.
audio-1919.800-1923.000|He was still alive, but he died on the way to the hospital.
audio-1924.000-1929.200|I thought Mike would have told you that Stu said I shook my head.
audio-1930.300-1934.000|I looked out at Lake Mendota last sailboats heading in.
audio-1934.900-1940.000|Picnic point was across the way a little Peninsula pointing into the water.
audio-1941.000-1946.800|Four five times a year my can I bike through drove to the parking lot nearest the trailhead and then made the Trek out to the end.
audio-1947.400-1952.200|It was at picnic point that we lost our virginity together on a beach towel.
audio-1952.000-1953.000|I still had.
audio-1953.600-1957.200|We were 16 then we thought we'd waited long enough.
audio-1958.700-1960.300|I turned back to Tsum.
audio-1961.000-1967.700|Would you dived like Austin's Reservoir if he'd come right up and said come on stew is great.
audio-1968.500-1969.400|Would you?
audio-1970.600-1973.300|Sure, you said why not?
audio-1976.700-1979.500|I'm at Mike a few weeks before Christmas the winter.
audio-1979.300-1986.100|I was 14 and it's probably true that if I had met him I would have met someone else and my story would have run an entirely different direction.
audio-1985.900-1993.000|Mike's to of course away from clausen's Reservoir away from the dive.
audio-1994.200-2002.600|Jamie and I were Christmas shopping that afternoon 9th graders in Twin fuzzy has to ward off the chill mine purple and hers red.
audio-2003.700-2007.100|Because I already had my mother Shelly scarf bought in rent.
audio-2006.900-2009.000|Not only Jamie left on my list.
audio-2008.800-2021.700|I spent the afternoon standing by while she bought things for her family and drop big obvious hints about what I could get her gold-plated hoop earrings a light blue Angora sweater.
audio-2022.500-2023.600|We were best friends.
audio-2023.400-2026.500|We were allowed to ask each other for the Moon.
audio-2027.700-2028.600|Late in the day.
audio-2028.400-2033.200|We wandered into the rink were school's hockey games were played and took seats on the bleachers.
audio-2034.400-2040.600|Freshman Hockey didn't appeal to a smudge but there was always the chance that we run into someone interesting while we were there.
audio-2040.400-2048.500|There was always that chance and everything we did which is why it's not really an exaggeration to say as I sat there in my Icelandic sweater.
audio-2048.300-2051.200|I felt as if I were waiting for my life to start.
audio-2052.500-2060.300|And there was Mike in the box across the ice from us his helmet off big and Young and Beautiful.
audio-2061.400-2064.700|I know Jamie number 24.
audio-2064.500-2068.500|I said by the gate next to number seven.
audio-2069.300-2070.600|Sevens in my math class.
audio-2070.400-2074.300|She said that grow kind of lad 24 is good.
audio-2075.600-2076.500|For a moment.
audio-2076.300-2087.700|I had the strangest feeling like a clear soundproof bubble head suddenly surrounded me the world still there on the other side, but beyond reach then everything was normal again.
audio-2087.500-2091.200|Yeah, he is I said, isn't he?
audio-2092.100-2095.900|I don't remember a thing about the game for once it was over.
audio-2095.700-2103.400|I talked to Jamie into waiting around outside the locker room where there was a bulletin board studded with colorful notices we can pretend to be reading.
audio-2104.300-2106.400|Finally out of the corner of my eye.
audio-2106.200-2110.800|I saw the math class Guy come out and I whisper to Jamie to go.
audio-2110.600-2111.100|Say hi.
audio-2112.200-2113.300|That was a rooster.
audio-2113.100-2115.800|Mike was right behind him.
audio-2116.900-2126.300|Jamie and rooster talked about the game for a few minutes and then together the four of us walked out into the frosty Madison dusk ending up in a diner on Regent Street.
audio-2126.100-2128.200|That was famous for its hot chocolate.
audio-2128.900-2132.600|Jamie and I sat on one side of the booth Mike and rooster on the other.
audio-2133.400-2137.500|Our orders came top with fluted Hills of reddi whip.
audio-2138.700-2142.500|At the school the following week the four of us met in the lunchroom and ain't together.
audio-2142.300-2154.900|I thought Mike Smothers sandwiches were a clue about her him the whole mayor family a perfect ruffle of lettuce for the address of the bread mustard on the meat and mayonnaise on the cheese.
audio-2155.700-2159.000|I lived alone with my mother and I was in chanted.
audio-2158.800-2163.400|I wanted to see where he lived even more than I wanted him to kiss me.
audio-2163.200-2166.400|But it all happened at once on Christmas Eve.
audio-2166.200-2168.200|Thanks to a piece of mistletoe.
audio-2168.000-2170.200|He told me later it got in his mother to hang.
audio-2171.200-2174.000|The mistletoe hung in the doorway to the kitchen.
audio-2173.800-2177.200|I smelled the dissolved end of his certs.
audio-2177.000-2179.000|I knew it.
audio-2178.800-2193.500|He said when we Departed you want 31 tell me my mother and I've been alone for over 10 years by then living the quiet still life of a girl and a woman left long before by a man.
audio-2194.300-2198.500|Life at the mayor's was the exact opposite and I never really looked back.
audio-2199.300-2200.600|All through high school.
audio-2200.400-2210.300|I went home from school with Mike stayed for dinner several times a week hung out there on weekends when they rented a cabin on Lake Superior each summer.
audio-2210.100-2218.300|I went to I have three memories of my father exactly three which is fitting given that was a number of years.
audio-2218.100-2219.200|He was in my life.
audio-2220.400-2226.400|I used to try to come up with others, but it was futile and exercise that led to remembering things.
audio-2226.200-2228.700|I hadn't witnessed stories.
audio-2228.500-2230.600|My mother had told me scenes.
audio-2230.400-2233.300|I've seen captured in photographs that it since disappeared.
audio-2234.600-2238.500|Memory is strange part movie part dream.
audio-2239.200-2245.300|You can never know if what you remember is the essential thing or something else entirely a Gracenote.
audio-2246.000-2247.800|Of my father hears what I have.
audio-2247.600-2260.500|It's late at night and from a darkened hallway see a man in a plaid bathrobe yelling at my mother who's standing before him in a long pink nightgown for hands clasped in front of her chest.

audio-2665.100-2670.200|Her face relaxed into a smile, but I could see she didn't have a clue where I was headed.
audio-2670.900-2676.400|And she said and I was thinking I'd make new ones for you.

audio-2753.900-2755.400|Although she didn't put it that way.

audio-3328.200-3331.700|If I'd wanted to hear a pair of guys needling each other.
audio-3331.500-3332.600|I could have hung out with the people.
audio-3332.400-3338.200|I usually hung out with the evening stretched ahead of me pointless and unending.
audio-3339.200-3347.000|Anya was grating cheese and she pause for a moment to look up me the men are sniffing each other too bad.
audio-3346.800-3349.300|They can't just each pee in a corner and be done with it.
audio-3350.300-3351.500|Back in the living room.
audio-3351.300-3361.200|I found them all still standing Tom and his brother off to the side looking at a book Victor glowering down at Kilroy when he saw me he muttered something then went into the kitchen.
audio-3361.000-3363.300|I looked at Kilroy.
audio-3363.100-3370.200|He was about my height 5 6 with a narrow sharp featured face and stradley brown hair.
audio-3370.900-3381.200|From the kitchen came the sound of Victor and Anya talking in their own language and after a moment Kilroy tilted his head in their Direction and then raised his eyebrows at me close friend of yours.
audio-3381.000-3383.300|I just work with him.
audio-3383.100-3388.500|I felt myself blush a little denying a stronger Connection in order to look good for this guy.
audio-3388.300-3392.300|We're at the UW Library.
audio-3392.100-3395.000|What do you do in New York?
audio-3394.800-3397.200|I mean, I shoot pool.
audio-3397.000-3399.100|No, really.
audio-3399.800-3401.000|You don't like pool.
audio-3400.800-3402.200|He shook his head.
audio-3403.000-3404.100|You don't know what you're missing.
audio-3403.900-3410.600|Of course, it helps that the right place to play on 6th Avenue right near my apartment.
audio-3410.400-3413.300|There's a bar called mcclanahan's with a pool table.
audio-3413.100-3423.300|That's got a tiny little gouge in the felt right near one of the side pockets and I'm such an accomplished student of that table that I can just about always make the gouge work for me.
audio-3424.000-3426.900|It struck me as the kind of person who's always joking.
audio-3426.700-3428.000|He joked is a way of life.
audio-3427.800-3431.500|But still I said I meant what do you do for work?
audio-3432.900-3440.700|He shook his head again work is beside the point is you learn someday when you're a little older I blushed again.
audio-3440.500-3442.300|I'm older than I look.
audio-3442.100-3449.700|I looked in my beer and took a long swag Richmond to look about twelve see how well I can drink beer.
audio-3449.500-3452.400|He smiled but he was watching me closely.
audio-3452.200-3457.500|And now he said you're 23, I'd say give or take no more than a year.
audio-3457.300-3459.700|Right I was taking back.

audio-3476.200-3481.200|How do I do my heart was beating wildly and I didn't know what to say.
audio-3481.000-3486.600|My could have been on a weekend fishing trip with his father was something the two of them didn't once or twice this summer.
audio-3487.400-3493.200|well versed you weren't entirely wrong or entirely, right?

audio-3508.400-3510.700|He pointed his own ring finger.
audio-3511.400-3514.900|He's both, but I was right about everything else.
audio-3515.900-3522.900|Are you came into the room then a huge steaming pot in her mitad hands in behind hurricane Victor carrying a bowl of salad.
audio-3522.700-3525.200|They put the food on the dining table.
audio-3525.000-3528.800|Then turn to face us almost everything else.
audio-3528.600-3531.500|I said to Kilroy but not quite.
audio-3534.000-3536.700|Book Hillary said haunted me all evening long.
audio-3536.500-3538.600|How could I have known?
audio-3538.400-3539.600|I was from Madison.
audio-3539.400-3545.800|Was there a never left home look about me and never left home never moved from boyfriend to boyfriend.
audio-3545.600-3548.300|Never surprised anyone look.
audio-3549.200-3559.600|The next morning, I woke with a headache and stuck with beer while everyone else had drunk Victor's polish vodka, but I'd stuck with a little too much of it and I felt terrible.
audio-3559.400-3566.400|I drink a big glass of water before my shower and another after and then it was time to go to Jamie's.
audio-3566.200-3576.600|She was throwing a going-away brunch for Christina morning Christian was moving to Boston for graduate school and although it seems wrong for us to gather without Mike.
audio-3576.400-3578.500|We had to observe the occasion somehow.
audio-3579.100-3582.700|Moving to Boston I envied her.
audio-3583.600-3599.500|Jamie at a typical Mifflin dining room with a pass through to the kitchen a bay window looking into the side yard and Wall of built-ins in this case of bank of drawers below a pair of glass front of cabinets that have been painted so often they no longer closed all the way.
audio-3599.300-3605.800|Jamie's parents have contributed an ancient dining room set it inherited from Jamie's grandmother.
audio-3605.600-3625.200|And once everyone arrived we settled into the heavy dark wood chairs Jamie at one end rooster at the other end Bill and Christine opposite means to Bill reached over and put a hand on Christine shoulder take broken up and gone back together so many times even they lost count.
audio-3625.000-3626.600|But now that she was leaving.
audio-3626.400-3627.900|He seemed really sad.
audio-3628.700-3634.300|Spotting them coming up with walk earlier, Jamie and said the bee looks grieved.
audio-3634.100-3640.700|He was good-looking dark and lanky with a sexy silver stud in one ear lobe, but he had booked.
audio-3641.800-3644.000|Rooster finally pushed back from the table.
audio-3643.800-3650.400|He stretched his legs to the side and patted his stomach the spare tire Spartans.
audio-3650.200-3655.000|He said just like Mike said I'm going to die when he wakes up.
audio-3654.800-3660.700|We all look down for a moment all of us, but rooster who in the angry way.
audio-3660.500-3662.500|He was looking at me when I looked up again.
audio-3662.300-3667.000|Tell me what I already knew that we were failing like fine not talkin about him.
audio-3666.800-3677.200|It was almost 3:30, and we've been sitting for a long time Jamie stood up and began to clear and I stretch my arms over my head and yell and then Rose to help her.
audio-3677.900-3679.400|Let's do something.
audio-3679.200-3683.500|I said to Jamie in the kitchen all of us go rent.
audio-3683.300-3685.700|Sell Boar's or play volleyball or something.
audio-3686.400-3692.300|Make like a beer commercial I could get into that we started back out to where the others were.
audio-3692.100-3694.400|But the phone rang just as we reached the doorway.
audio-3694.200-3695.600|Go ahead.
audio-3695.400-3699.400|Jamie said I'll be right there sailboards.
audio-3700.200-3703.600|I found them sitting in silence all looking stupefied.
audio-3704.200-3705.700|Perk up guys.
audio-3705.500-3708.700|They said but then Jamie was gripping my arm.
audio-3708.500-3710.400|It's for you.
audio-3710.200-3714.300|She said the phone mrs. Mayor.
audio-3716.700-3720.200|My kid woken up and now I cried freely.
audio-3720.900-3729.900|I cried when I hung up the phone I cried when I felt Jamie's arms around me and I cried as everyone came into the kitchen and hugged me rooster Titus ball.
audio-3730.500-3738.300|After Mike died of the circles on the reservoir had why didn't exactly in time with my growing sense that something was terribly wrong.
audio-3739.300-3747.000|The relief I felt now was explosive like the sudden service thing is someone from underwater spray shooting everywhere.
audio-3747.800-3753.700|Rooster drove me to the hospital and I kept crying leaning against the window and looking at the quiet day.
audio-3754.600-3755.800|It's okay.
audio-3755.600-3761.400|Mrs. Mayor said when we arrived at the Intensive Care lounge and I'd fling myself into her arms.
audio-3761.200-3766.100|So glad he'd woken so glad I was glad it's okay.
audio-3767.300-3774.000|When we were allowed in the mayor's told me I could go loan if I wanted or with rooster, but I wanted mrs. Mayor with me.
audio-3774.700-3790.300|Mike lay on his back no change of parent for my previous visit the ventilator washed inside washed inside his arms and legs are heavy and pale and his eyes his eyes were closed.
audio-3790.100-3792.300|He's sleeping.
audio-3792.100-3793.700|This is Mayor whispered.
audio-3793.500-3794.900|It's normal.
audio-3795.500-3796.400|I nodded.
audio-3797.200-3800.000|We're going to turn a den into a bedroom for him.
audio-3799.800-3802.400|She said because of the stairs.
audio-3803.300-3807.300|I felt new tears stream down my face and without looking at me.
audio-3807.100-3808.000|She took my hand.
audio-3807.800-3814.000|There's the TV already in there and we'll hook up his stereo to maybe he wants to build a new bathroom.
audio-3813.800-3822.500|His dad thinks we should wait and see but we have to be ready before Michael is It's true I said.
audio-3823.400-3833.300|Mike said Michael at first I thought I was imagining it but his eyelids fluttered a little and then opened.
audio-3833.100-3836.300|He looks straight at me his great.
audio-3836.100-3837.800|I surprisingly clear.
audio-3837.600-3841.200|Could he see me see anything?
audio-3842.100-3851.800|his eyes closed again and he slept For the next several days, I went to the hospital whenever I could for work after work.
audio-3851.600-3859.600|Sometimes almost guiltlessly during work explaining to miss crafts and then I'd be right back and then Vanishing for an hour.
audio-3859.400-3861.200|Sometimes.
audio-3861.000-3867.700|He never opened his eyes while I was there, but on others he seemed quite alert seem to recognize me.
audio-3867.500-3876.400|I began to talk to him just like it's me and I love you and everything's going to be okay.
audio-3878.100-3886.100|The doctors tested him a search for sensation in motion for reflexes Buffalo the chest it was as if he were dead.
audio-3887.100-3895.100|At least the injury happened at the lower part of the cervical spine and doctor said at least he'll be able to breathe on his own.
audio-3895.900-3897.900|And it was true.
audio-3898.700-3907.400|Although I felt there was some faulty logic and being glad about any of it the word quadriplegic and Compass situations that were far worse than Mike's.
audio-3908.000-3908.900|Think of it.
audio-3908.700-3914.000|This one said another doctor with an injury at the C5 6 level.
audio-3913.800-3919.300|He's technically a quadriplegic but a function like a paraplegic without hands.
audio-3920.000-3936.800|I understood what he meant that Mike would be able to use his shoulders and upper arms that with mechanical devices strapped to his forearms and be able to manipulate things, but I couldn't finish the gruesome image Mike with his hands chopped off blood pouring from the stumps.
audio-3937.600-3938.500|You hurt yourself.
audio-3938.300-3944.100|We told him remember the reservoir you dovin ain't your head?
audio-3944.800-3948.300|It was terrible to see the anguish on his face.
audio-3948.100-3953.800|Terrible not to know how much you understood the breathing to prevent him from speaking.
audio-3953.600-3957.400|So even once he was more alert he couldn't ask questions.
audio-3958.100-3972.300|Army the mayor's decided he had to hear at all a full description of the accident and wanted it done to him be agreed that I would wait in the lounge then going afterward visiting hours hadn't officially started yet and have the place to myself.
audio-3973.500-3995.100|Finally the neurosurgeon doctor Spellman Stern past heading for Mike's room and I understood that at that moment like new mayors and ask the doctor to let them tell Mike what he's lost but they wanted him to explain how Mike might be able to get a little of it back surgery to fuse a cervical spine and then months and months of in hospital rehab.
audio-3996.400-4004.700|The idea of Mike lying there knowing my eyes filled and I stood up and began pacing fighting hard not to cry again.
audio-4005.700-4009.200|A little later doctor Spellman appeared at the entrance to the lounge.
audio-4009.000-4013.700|He came in and looked at me and certainly then suggested we sit down.
audio-4013.500-4020.000|I've just been with Mike he said He's very strong your boyfriend.
audio-4019.800-4022.700|We're going to move ahead on the cervical fusion.
audio-4023.400-4026.600|He paused and I wondered why he coming to talk to me.
audio-4026.400-4031.800|We never spoken privately before and I was surprised he even knew who I was.
audio-4032.800-4037.900|I'm glad I saw you in here continuing it's premature to think too far ahead.
audio-4037.700-4038.700|But here you are.
audio-4038.500-4052.900|So I'll break my own rule do the person Mike seems most concerned about most aware of the nurses of notice that he's a lot more alert after your visits and after his parents say and just now we seem to want to know where you were.
audio-4053.800-4061.300|when gauged I said except that everything's changed now, although that can be hard to keep inside.
audio-4061.100-4065.900|Sometimes I counsel you to go very gently these next few months.
audio-4065.700-4067.800|We have is very hard work.
audio-4067.600-4074.400|A lot of getting better is wanting to He stood up and cleared his throat and I feel my face burning.
audio-4074.200-4078.200|My fingers were actually shaking as he walked away.
audio-4078.000-4082.600|I imagine my own outrage voice calling out to him, you know, nothing about me.
audio-4082.400-4085.300|It's not one single thing.
audio-4086.600-4090.300|I stood up and headed for Mike's room just outside.
audio-4090.100-4102.300|I pause for a moment and looked in this is Mary Esther the foot of Mike's bed looking flushed but composed I miss her Mayer was weeping sitting in the one share his glasses ask you in his lap.
audio-4102.100-4104.200|His big hands cupped over his eyes.
audio-4105.000-4107.100|I stepped in the mail looked at me.
audio-4107.900-4113.700|Immediately Mike began blinking furiously and I squeezed past mr. Mayor and sit over him.
audio-4114.300-4125.300|I'm sorry, he mouthed his gray eyes were hard on me moving over my face looking and looking for where I was now.
audio-4126.100-4129.100|We're giving what it happened to him.
audio-4130.000-4133.200|We're giving the months before hands.
audio-4133.900-4135.200|Forget all of that.
audio-4135.000-4141.200|I longed to say but not in front of his parents and how to retract something.
audio-4141.000-4146.600|I've never spoken in the first place or more spoiled through me, but I could not dwell on it.
audio-4146.400-4146.800|Now.
audio-4146.600-4153.200|I stepped forward and touched his forearm then move my fingers around to where he had some sensation.
audio-4153.800-4155.400|I stroked his skin.
audio-4156.100-4157.100|Don't worry.
audio-4156.900-4159.800|I said I love you.
audio-4159.600-4160.400|Don't worry.
audio-4161.100-4169.000|Grateful release sold his pale face color in his cheeks and outlining his dry lips.
audio-4171.400-4175.300|The day of the surgery arrived from movies and TV.
audio-4175.100-4189.500|I had an image of a fish and bustle all those people in masks and gowns that fell apart when I heard Mr. Met or talked about whether they going from the front of Mike snack of the back knives cutting him open his blood spilling.
audio-4189.300-4191.100|It was unbearable.
audio-4190.900-4193.200|Don't touch him.
audio-4193.000-4194.600|I wanted to shriek.
audio-4195.500-4209.900|weird with my schedule Sonya the or the mayor's wurster and I finally after almost 3 hours doctor Spellman came in and said it's over everything went smoothly.
audio-4209.700-4215.300|He's in recovery and we bow our heads and what each one of us.
audio-4216.100-4219.200|Only one person was allowed in and his mother insisted.
audio-4219.000-4222.500|So it was the next morning before I could see him.
audio-4223.500-4232.000|He lay flat on his back his head encircled by a steel band that is attached to his skull with screws taught struts.
audio-4231.800-4234.800|Join the band to a bulky sheepskin vest he wore.
audio-4236.300-4239.200|Oh my God, I heard myself say.
audio-4240.200-4249.600|Mr. And mrs. Mayor were nowhere to be seen But Julian John Junior were there and they turned it the sound of my voice exactly is Mike size.
audio-4249.400-4250.200|Found me.
audio-4251.900-4253.200|That's the Halo.
audio-4253.000-4254.900|Julie said flatly.
audio-4255.700-4266.700|Nehalem the device to keep his neck from moving post-surgery Somehow I expected something less medieval-looking something more like a Halo.
audio-4267.400-4274.900|Hi I said as I move closer to him, I felt something faltering me some kind of car is a resolve.
audio-4275.500-4278.000|He looked Summers face full of Shadows.
audio-4279.000-4285.200|How I send I my mouth is like cotton.
audio-4286.300-4291.300|How do you feel he licked his lips my head hurts.
audio-4291.100-4292.600|He said hoarsely.
audio-4293.400-4296.900|I nodded and it was a moment before I realized.
audio-4297.700-4301.700|He'd spoken the tube into his throat was gone.
audio-4301.500-4303.600|The ventilator was off.
audio-4303.400-4316.400|Its his extinguished your talkin I said your off the ventilator He didn't answer and Julie said they're weaning him off of it a little at a time.
audio-4317.500-4322.400|A few minutes inner side never really talked to came in should an angry look on her face.
audio-4322.200-4324.300|What are you doing?
audio-4324.100-4328.100|She demanded and for a second, I wasn't sure whom she was addressing.
audio-4327.900-4330.000|She was looking straight at Mike.
audio-4329.800-4333.100|One of you has to go now.
audio-4332.900-4335.700|I turn to Mike and smiled.
audio-4335.500-4337.500|I'll come back later.
audio-4337.300-4339.000|Okay in a few hours.
audio-4340.200-4343.000|Don't go Julie picked up.
audio-4342.800-4351.300|Her purse will go she just in the strap on her shoulder and look meaningfully it John mom and dad will be back soon Mike.
audio-4351.100-4358.800|Okay, John followed after her I looked at the screws go into Mike's head then quickly looked away.
audio-4359.600-4361.500|It was important to talk to him.
audio-4361.300-4362.800|But what can I say?
audio-4363.800-4368.500|Made a noise in his throat as if he were trying to clear but couldn't very well.
audio-4368.300-4373.800|Could you kiss me he said I was stunned.
audio-4373.600-4376.000|I wish you would kiss me.
audio-4375.800-4377.600|He went on.
audio-4378.800-4391.700|Carrie and it was only then when you said my name that the real long missing the sound of his voice finally reached me his distinctive low voice which have been silenced so long.
audio-4392.300-4394.200|Tears stream for my eyes.
audio-4394.000-4398.200|How was it that I hadn't thought about his voice mail hasn't missed it.
audio-4398.000-4405.700|He was waiting and I wipe the tears away with the sides of my four fingers then dried my hands in my pants.
audio-4406.500-4416.400|I lower my face but then stopped and sure how to avoid the Halo what would happen if I touched it would hurt him slowly carefully.
audio-4416.200-4419.400|I press my mouth to his cheek and pulled away.
audio-4419.200-4422.700|He'd pursed his lips and was holding them together.
audio-4422.500-4427.400|He started into my eyes until I bent again, press my lips to his.
audio-4428.500-4436.100|I was about to straighten up when I felt his tongue against my mouth soft and warm and infinitely familiar.
audio-4439.400-4444.000|4 days later Mike started rehab and suddenly everything was different.
audio-4443.800-4448.000|Your the nurses were pant suits and more brisk and businesslike.
audio-4447.800-4455.100|Even if it military, let's go they say there be no time for protest.
audio-4454.900-4465.400|They have you going whether it was into your wheelchair on to your other side or up to eat rehab was exhausting sometimes Mike seemed so overwhelmed you can't even talk.
audio-4465.200-4470.100|He just lie there while we chatted with each other as face drawing with fatigue.
audio-4469.900-4472.300|I slipped into despair.
audio-4472.100-4473.900|I couldn't help it.
audio-4473.700-4475.800|He was never going to walk again.
audio-4475.600-4482.000|He was going to live life from a wheelchair watch Life from a wheelchair.
audio-4482.900-4487.100|I showed up to visit but it was hard for me to talk or the smile.
audio-4486.900-4488.700|I did talk.
audio-4488.500-4491.200|I did smile, but I felt fake.
audio-4491.900-4493.400|At home afterward.
audio-4493.200-4497.000|I sat still for hours sometimes or I sewed.
audio-4498.000-4503.500|The Saturday of paddle and Portage came and Jamie arrange for us to meet rooster and Stu there.
audio-4503.300-4507.800|I had no desire to go, but I also had no desire not too.
audio-4507.600-4513.100|So I agree she pick me up at my apartment and we walked over to James, Madison Park.
audio-4513.900-4541.800|Paddle and Portage was a Madison tradition a yearly canoe Comfort race that Drew competitors from all over the Midwest serious athletes and we can Runners hundreds of people ready to paddle halfway across Lake Mendota and back then to run carrying their canoes up the hill Halfway Around the Capitol and down the other side and finally to paddle another course on Lake Monona rooster and suet State down picnic table.
audio-4541.600-4564.700|The park was beyond crowded all the contestants plus The Observers bikes Tangled against trees a voice over the loudspeaker announced the first heat was about to go and Jamie and I climbed onto the picnic table so we can see a gunshot sound in the canoes hit the water 30 or 40 of them their destination of sailboat anchored off picnic point.
audio-4565.000-4574.500|We watch them moving across the water, but after a while it got hard to see who was winning and soon even to know who was still heading away and who had already turned back.
audio-4574.300-4582.600|Why do I forget binoculars every year stew said, why do I come every year Jamie countered?
audio-4582.400-4587.600|She climb down and sat on the table or feet on the bench after a moment.
audio-4587.400-4590.400|I sat to bed myself against the Heat.
audio-4590.200-4592.300|It was already at least 90.
audio-4592.100-4594.100|I'm bored.
audio-4593.900-4596.300|Jamie said let's do something.
audio-4596.100-4597.500|Let's go to Chicago.
audio-4597.300-4599.100|What now?
audio-4598.900-4602.200|I've been planning to head to the hospital after the race.
audio-4602.800-4609.000|Jamie Shrugged why not his fingers and stretched his arms over his head.
audio-4609.900-4611.200|It's not a bad idea.
audio-4611.000-4614.600|You send three hours in an air-conditioned car.
audio-4614.400-4615.100|Sounds good.
audio-4614.900-4616.500|No matter what's on the other end.
audio-4616.300-4620.900|I don't think so restore said why not?
audio-4620.700-4625.000|I have a date a date.
audio-4624.800-4627.400|You said call the papers.
audio-4627.200-4628.000|It's a miracle.
audio-4627.800-4634.800|Shut up rooster said that he was smiling suddenly his teeth white against the pink of his face.
audio-4634.600-4648.300|Jamie leaned forward with Joan he said I look to Jamie dance to nurse Joan I said from intensive care.
audio-4649.200-4664.800|He nodded I couldn't believe it don't have to be at least 30 and then there were her looks that fragile pale skin and her long blond hair and her height roosters usual day was the kind of girl who'd be cast as a loyal best friend in the movie.
audio-4664.600-4671.500|Not exactly pretty but spunky and with a bit of a mouth which was where thing is generally went wrong.
audio-4671.300-4674.500|As far as rooster was concerned actually.
audio-4674.300-4681.000|His usual date was no one people around us moved toward the shoreline yelling and cheering and jae-min.
audio-4680.800-4683.400|I climb back onto the table to see over the crown.
audio-4683.900-4689.500|Mike and I are going to do it this year rooster said suddenly we were going to surprise you guys.
audio-4689.300-4691.700|I looked down at him.

audio-4714.900-4717.700|You said that doesn't sound like Mike.
audio-4717.500-4720.300|I think there was something else on his mind.
audio-4720.100-4726.300|I think it was actually really worried about something my face filled with heat.
audio-4726.100-4729.900|This could not be happening after moment.
audio-4729.700-4733.000|I got off the table and walked away free of the crowd.
audio-4732.800-4734.800|I stopped and leaned against the tree.
audio-4734.600-4742.100|I looked out at the lake picnic point across the water the Anchorage sailboat that marked the turning around point of the race.
audio-4741.900-4744.000|He's sorry.

audio-4783.900-4785.000|Okay, and I'll call you tomorrow.
audio-4784.800-4787.400|She frowned and looked away.
audio-4788.200-4792.300|First thing tomorrow I said, I promise.
audio-4793.000-4796.100|Once they left I went back to the picnic table and sat down.
audio-4795.900-4800.600|I watch the end of the first heat and then the beginning of the second.
audio-4801.100-4816.100|A guy was coming toward me with a cautiously friendly look on his face as if he thought he knew me but wasn't sure he had light brown hair and wire frame glasses and more retro shirt burgundy and cream nylon and wide vertical stripes.
audio-4815.900-4817.600|Carrie.

audio-4839.100-4840.700|I look human.
audio-4840.500-4842.700|I just started sacrifice.
audio-4842.500-4844.600|My beauty is socks for more up-to-date.
audio-4844.400-4848.100|Look at 1782 hidden behind a curtain of hair.
audio-4847.900-4852.100|He's had a few rows over for me spend whole class periods.
audio-4851.900-4852.900|Doodling in a notebook.
audio-4852.700-4854.300|What's up?
audio-4854.100-4855.300|I said to him now.

audio-4865.900-4871.700|So tell me he said whatever happened to Carrie Bell.
audio-4871.500-4873.900|Are you still in touch with Jamie Fletcher?

audio-4878.600-4883.200|I said and Mike Maher cutest couple in the senior class.
audio-4883.000-4892.000|I blushed even then it has made me cringe the yearbook staff and made his pose for a picture and was the only picture of the two of us.
audio-4891.800-4896.200|I didn't like holding hands and look like.
audio-4896.000-4897.200|It made us both look retarded.
audio-4898.300-4899.200|We're engaged.
audio-4899.000-4902.400|I told Simon when's the happy day?
audio-4903.600-4907.300|I looked at the lake Mike's in the hospital.
audio-4907.100-4910.800|He was in a diving accident six weeks ago when he broke his neck.
audio-4911.800-4913.100|Oh my God.

audio-4915.800-4917.400|Thanks.
audio-4917.200-4923.300|We stood there without saying any more for what seemed like an age I should get going.
audio-4923.100-4926.200|I said are you on foot?
audio-4926.000-4931.400|He has a tainted look on his face and he didn't want to intrude we can walk together.
audio-4931.200-4934.400|Okay, I send though.
audio-4934.200-4940.300|I didn't know where we go or what we say why I was agreeing we wound up walking to campus.
audio-4941.300-4942.500|So, where'd you go to college?
audio-4942.300-4945.100|They said he looked embarrassed.
audio-4946.200-4948.900|Yeah, excuse me.
audio-4948.700-4959.200|At least I didn't say a little school in Connecticut is certain of my acquaintances have been known to do at least there's that we both smiled and he tipped his head toward the building.
audio-4959.000-4961.400|We were passing you want to hear?
audio-4962.100-4964.900|alas Are you in a sorority?
audio-4965.900-4978.000|Please I would have had to dye my hair blond and it half my brain cells surgically removed actually my crushed but then last minute he pulled out his dad was really into it.
audio-4977.800-4984.700|But Mike realized he'd be living with a bunch of guys out of Animal House and he decided no way he lives at home all four years.
audio-4984.500-4987.100|I'm always doing that.
audio-4986.900-4991.700|I've been said rushing around and change my mind about all kinds of guys.
audio-4991.500-4995.900|I studied him his face still in serious.
audio-4997.100-4999.600|Are you gay he nodded?

audio-5002.500-5005.200|You mean with my parents he grinned.

audio-5008.000-5011.300|Thanks for flying all the way out here, Mom and Dad.
audio-5011.100-5015.700|Oh by the way, I'm gay actually doesn't seem to bother the munch.
audio-5016.400-5023.800|Sun shade table in the Union Terrace and we sat and talked through two cups of coffee each and then sandwiches and then ice cream cones.
audio-5023.600-5034.500|I found myself telling him more than I told anyone else about my slow cooling toward Mike for the accident my horrible numbness afterward the despair.
audio-5034.300-5035.100|I felt now.
audio-5035.900-5037.200|What are you going to do?
audio-5037.000-5046.700|Simon said what do you mean I asked how I knew was I going to be strong and good and devote myself to Mike or wasn't I?
audio-5046.500-5048.200|I don't know.
audio-5048.000-5049.500|I told Simon.
audio-5050.400-5051.600|He shook his head.
audio-5051.400-5055.300|I can't even imagine you must be in such pain.
audio-5055.100-5059.600|I nodded in tears to get my eyes, but rather than look away.
audio-5059.400-5062.900|He continue to look at me his face full of compassion.
audio-5062.700-5065.700|I hope you don't think this is weird.
audio-5065.500-5068.900|He said but I'm really glad I ran into you today.
audio-5068.700-5070.700|I am too.
audio-5071.400-5078.800|We've been sitting for hours and it was obviously time to leave we pushed back from our table and strolled through the union and said goodbye out front.
audio-5078.600-5083.700|I felt open an elevated or like the person I wanted to be then I'd felt in months.
audio-5084.800-5088.100|It was after 3 past time for me to visit Mike.
audio-5087.900-5089.900|I started toward home.

audio-5126.200-5129.600|He marched over and said we have to talk.
audio-5130.500-5132.500|I glanced around and put a finger to my lips.
audio-5132.300-5134.600|Don't shush me.
audio-5134.400-5139.300|He said evenly I drove all the way up here just walk out into the hall with me.
audio-5140.300-5153.200|I got my purse from the staff room and headed for the door several Paces ahead of me rooster led the way down to the ground floor and out of the library not looking back once finally stopped and leaned against the building.
audio-5153.000-5157.000|We were on a wide empty Plaza the sun blazing down.

audio-5175.500-5176.800|What are you talkin about?
audio-5177.900-5179.600|His eyes widened.
audio-5179.400-5181.300|What am I talking about?
audio-5181.100-5184.300|I'm talking about Mike Jesus fucking Christ.
audio-5184.100-5184.900|Carry.
audio-5184.700-5187.400|He threw up his hands in disgust.
audio-5187.200-5189.400|When was the last time you were at the hospital?
audio-5189.200-5203.100|The answer was Friday after skipping Saturday been all too but easy maybe or inevitable to skip yesterday to I know when he said why didn't you go yesterday?
audio-5202.900-5204.700|Why didn't you go Saturday?
audio-5204.500-5207.500|Because I didn't feel like it.
audio-5208.600-5216.700|His mouth tightened you think I felt like it you think mrs. Mayor felt like seeing your son with his head in a fucking cage.
audio-5216.500-5218.400|No one feels like and you go.
audio-5218.200-5220.000|Anyway, that's what love means.
audio-5219.800-5221.600|Oh really?
audio-5221.400-5225.200|I said, I thought it meant never having to say you're sorry.
audio-5226.200-5229.200|He turn and slam the edge of his fists against the wall.
audio-5229.000-5232.800|I can't get through to you you some cold woman.

audio-5238.300-5240.200|Okay, don't keep him hanging.

audio-5364.000-5370.000|She said I'll be there in 10 minutes across the room and force myself to pick up the receiver.

audio-6102.500-6104.300|She flung them to the sides.
audio-6104.100-6109.300|She's like a thirteen-year-old too dumb to finesse her curfew every night.
audio-6109.100-6114.700|Mom sees awake until she hears a Lynn tiptoeing up the stairs now she wants me to talk to her.
audio-6115.500-6117.800|Are you going to fuck?

audio-6150.800-6152.300|We managed say goodbye.
audio-6154.900-6157.400|I turned around and headed up State Street.

audio-6159.800-6172.200|It was the only boutiki fabric store in town and it had prices to match but I loved it love to go into one room on the Liberty Cotton's to standing all before the wall of silks in the back.
audio-6172.900-6174.000|From the sidewalk.
audio-6173.800-6175.100|I looked in the window.
audio-6174.900-6182.500|There was a sleeveless blue dress hanging their beautifully simple with a square neckline and a nip in waist.
audio-6183.100-6189.000|The envelope for the pattern had been pinned to one shoulder a Vogue pattern I'd used once.
audio-6189.700-6190.500|Through the window.
audio-6190.300-6196.100|I couldn't really tell what the fabric was like, so I went inside and reached over the display ledge for a touch.
audio-6195.900-6199.000|It felt like silky tissue paper.
audio-6198.800-6202.700|I looked at the tag $40 a yard.
audio-6204.100-6206.800|A roll of washed silk caught my eye.
audio-6206.600-6212.300|The color was beautiful a warm pale gold like honey in sunlight.
audio-6212.100-6217.300|I looked up and found a saleswoman watching me buying or browsing.
audio-6218.200-6220.500|Maybe both but I can't decide.
audio-6221.200-6229.800|on the fabric or the pattern either Smiling she picked up the role of washed silk and led me to a full-length mirror.

audio-6267.400-6271.700|I heard my mother's voice asking if I'd get much use out of it.
audio-6271.500-6281.800|Jamie's voice saying I could buy a nice nightgown, but then I wondered what Mike would say and in a moment he was standing in front of me carefully.
audio-6281.600-6289.100|I'm tying the ribbon pushing the robe for my shoulders and I thought that although he would probably never be able to do that.
audio-6288.900-6293.500|I should make the gown and robe anyway an offering to memory.
audio-6293.900-6306.500|or to the Future I carried the fabric back down State Street to my car all 8 and 1/2 yards a bit over $200 worth of silk in a paper bag.

audio-6401.800-6404.300|But I've been working like a fucking dog this summer.
audio-6405.300-6415.600|After he got back on his bike and wave goodbye us with my finger under the flap of the envelope inside was a piece of lined yellow paper Sunday 2 a.m.
audio-6415.400-6420.400|It said at the top deer carry Bell finally.
audio-6420.200-6424.000|I know the reason for your sad eyes and silence and I'm selfish.
audio-6423.800-6430.400|We looking for forgiveness the problem with reading Minds that you can get awfully close and still miss the essential thing.
audio-6430.200-6440.200|I hope Mike wakes to your vigilance in love soon and that you'll be well together Kilroy PS try pool.
audio-6441.000-6448.500|I thought of that evening back in June onion the kitchen cooking Victor towering over Kilroy in the living room.
audio-6448.300-6451.800|So offended by his questions that he finally stalked away.
audio-6453.100-6457.400|Kilroy with his narrow body and sharp face staring at me.
audio-6457.200-6459.000|Summon me up.
audio-6459.700-6476.300|they're blue quietness to him some kind of smooth blend covering over a sharp watchfulness the sense of an engine in there running all the time something else to so He was cocky at the same time that he mocked his own cockiness.
audio-6477.200-6482.300|I read the letter second time then I put it back in the envelope and put the envelope in my purse.
audio-6482.100-6486.900|I felt his eyes on me all through dinner that night studying me.
audio-6486.700-6489.400|It turned out wondering about me.
audio-6492.600-6494.500|Silk was like nothing.
audio-6494.300-6510.600|I'd ever worked with the for slippery and so fluid it was almost as if it were alive slithering from my table onto the floor sliding off the deck of my sewing machine if I was careless when I pull the needle out if I didn't have my hands right there to coax it to stay.
audio-6511.400-6513.400|I made the nightgown first.
audio-6513.200-6520.000|It was basically two bias-cut panels a shaped, but just barely joined along the sides.
audio-6519.800-6524.800|I finished the home late one night and then hung the gallon on a hanger and put it in my closet.
audio-6524.600-6527.900|Where would be the first thing I saw when I woke the next morning.
audio-6528.900-6533.400|During those days of sewing I felt distracted a lot at work.
audio-6533.200-6542.500|I'd suddenly come to myself a book in hand a wall of shelves before me and actually have to shake my head to get myself clear whatever stage of the sewing.
audio-6542.300-6544.600|I've been at when it stopped the night before.
audio-6545.600-6556.200|Victor shot me his usual looks of concern and I gave him said Smiles let him think it was all just too hard having Mike in the hospital, but that was my problem.
audio-6556.000-6558.000|Of course.
audio-6557.800-6558.800|That was my problem.
audio-6558.600-6568.900|I knew that every minute so when you're not sewing with Mike or not, and he got lower and lower sometimes barely registered my presents one evening.
audio-6568.700-6571.400|I arrive for my visit and found him not lying on his bed.
audio-6571.200-6582.700|But sitting in his wheelchair a first for after dinner, I have you strapped holding his torso in place while you're up I said, I can't believe it gave me a look.
audio-6583.700-6586.500|What isn't it ironic?
audio-6586.300-6588.700|I'm a loquat and yet I'm up.
audio-6589.500-6599.500|Week ago he reported that he heard one of the physical therapy assistants using the phrase loquat in reference to another patient with a relatively low cervical spine injury.
audio-6600.400-6603.800|I looked around the room all the Mayors were there.
audio-6603.600-6611.900|Mr. And mrs. And chairs opposite the foot of Mike's bed Jubilee and John Junior on the floor to the side hard day.
audio-6611.700-6614.800|I said Just the usual.

audio-6618.300-6624.600|I am mr. And mrs. Mayor exchanged a glance and I moved closer to Mike.
audio-6624.400-6626.700|Are there too many people here.
audio-6626.500-6627.700|I whispered.
audio-6627.500-6628.800|Do you want me to go?
audio-6629.800-6639.600|If you want, what do you want Mike's face when livid and he shouted stop asking me what I want.
audio-6639.400-6651.700|He stared at me with his eyes burning his words bouncing off the hard surfaces of the room and keeping us both absolutely still finally the color in his face began to drain away and he said quite calmly.
audio-6652.600-6656.000|Why do people keep asking me what I want?
audio-6655.800-6659.600|I want to walk out of here Christ.
audio-6659.400-6661.000|I want to walk.
audio-6663.300-6671.100|Simon roads called me one evening near the end of August and we talked for almost 3 hours the longest side spent doing anything but snowing in months.
audio-6670.900-6677.900|So what's new in the Carrie Bell Saga he said will you hear the latest in the Simon Road Saga?
audio-6677.700-6684.700|He told me about life in New York about his problems with his boyfriend about the big dilapidated Brownstone.
audio-6684.500-6689.900|He shared with a bunch of yell friends about the Park Avenue Law Firm where he worked as a proofreader.
audio-6689.700-6702.900|It had the unlikely name of Biggs leper Rush Creighton and Fenelon, but he said all the proofreaders refer to it as the big leper Rush what he really wanted was to be an illustrator.
audio-6703.900-6717.000|I told him about Mike sadness about how difficult it was to watch about the rare moments when some piece of his former self came through when he joked with Stu were billed ribbed rooster about Joan attaches.
audio-6716.800-6722.200|I in their past between us a recognition of the fact that he didn't have any of that available for me right now.
audio-6723.000-6734.900|It sounds hard Simon said and I was grateful I could tell him anything and it would be okay the word zooming away from Madison safely gone just moments after I'd other them.
audio-6735.500-6739.500|Before we hung up I said I want you to pay for half the call, but he wouldn't hear of it.
audio-6739.300-6740.900|Are you kidding?
audio-6740.700-6743.000|He said this is the most fun.
audio-6742.800-6746.800|I've had since I played twister in the cold Patterson's birthday party in fourth grade.
audio-6746.600-6753.400|I laughed but I knew what he meant fun might not be the word, but there was something about talking to him.
audio-6753.200-6754.500|It was deeply satisfying.
audio-6756.300-6770.400|It was nearly midnight, but I put on some shoes and went down to my car the urge to move propelling me across the Isthmus that divided the lakes and around Lake Monona the big round darkness of it blending with reflected bits of the half moon.
audio-6771.000-6773.100|I got on the Beltline heading west.
audio-6772.900-6784.300|I was coming around Middleton when I finally got off and I slowed to Wine through cul-de-sac land until I reach the strip of big faceless restaurants that have been our destination.
audio-6784.100-6794.400|So often on countless nights when we've been cruising too long and want a pancakes or big wide platters of french fries and been that far west ninjas.
audio-6794.200-6796.600|It was a strange foreign land.
audio-6797.500-6826.700|I was about to head for home when I glanced across the nearly empty parking lot and saw a woman standing by herself under the front light of the Ali-A ready cocktail lounge I'd heard about but never been in there was something familiar about her something in the way she stood but I couldn't figure out what I pulled into a gas station and swung around so I could go back out the way I'd come I drove into the alley parking lot and then I saw it was Lynn Fletcher Jamie's younger sister.
audio-6827.400-6840.500|She was standing just in front of the entrance one leg crossed in front of the other wearing a short skirt and an oversized jean jacket, her hair was big into shoveled as if she just teased it and discussed it with hairspray.
audio-6840.300-6850.000|I stopped in front of her and she glanced once at my car and then looked away Reaching Across The Sea Thai rolled down the passenger side window and called her name.
audio-6849.800-6858.100|She lets them against I'm stooping to look through the open window or hand fluter mouth Perry.
audio-6859.300-6860.500|What are you doing here?
audio-6860.300-6864.300|Nothing waiting for someone come here.
audio-6864.100-6866.100|I said Motion in her to the car.
audio-6865.900-6869.500|She hesitated and took a few steps closer to me.
audio-6870.400-6871.400|Who you meeting?
audio-6871.200-6876.800|I send a friend from work the restaurant where she waitress was nearby.
audio-6876.600-6892.100|I recalled Spinelli's I wondered how she was going to get into the alley if she had a fake ID or maybe no one would card her that she looked about 16 standing there in her too short skirt big silver hoops hanging from her ears.
audio-6891.900-6894.000|She took a step closer.
audio-6893.800-6895.700|Don't tell okay.
audio-6895.500-6902.400|Don't tell who I cut the engine and after a moment lean to order and open the door sit with me for a sec.
audio-6902.200-6903.300|I haven't seen you in ages.
audio-6903.100-6907.100|She looked toward the road then Shrugged and got in the car.
audio-6907.600-6911.100|I mean don't tell Jamie what are you up to?
audio-6910.900-6918.800|I just have a date with just someone I met at work even a customer Jesus.
audio-6918.600-6919.900|Do you really think that's a good idea?

audio-6922.800-6926.200|Do a lot of the customers in on you carry.
audio-6926.000-6927.700|She gave me a heart.
audio-6927.500-6933.600|Look they're just friendly I'll bet she Shrugged hugging a little later skirt.
audio-6933.400-6936.100|Do you let these guys think you're 21.
audio-6935.900-6937.400|She left it.
audio-6937.200-6940.200|I realized that she had a drink or two already that she was.
audio-6940.000-6944.200|In fact on her way to being drunk Lynn turn toward me with a giggle.
audio-6944.000-6949.000|Sorry don't tell but I sometimes play this little game with them.
audio-6948.800-6951.000|I let them buy me a couple of drinks.
audio-6950.800-6957.500|Then I say I have to get home for my curfew or my parents will get mad and they just like freaked your parents.
audio-6957.300-6958.500|How old are you?
audio-6958.300-6960.700|I said to this one guy a couple nights ago.

audio-6966.500-6970.500|I thought you were twenty-two at least my daughter 16.
audio-6970.300-6972.100|I gave me a twenty not to tell anyone.
audio-6972.900-6976.300|When I started her cheeses, are you kidding?
audio-6976.100-6978.200|It's fun.
audio-6978.000-6980.700|It's stupid her eyes.
audio-6980.500-6981.200|Got big.
audio-6981.000-6982.900|You're not going to tell Jamie.
audio-6982.700-6985.500|Are you she tell my mother for sure promise me?

audio-6994.200-6995.400|All right.
audio-6995.200-7001.500|She settled her purse strap on her shoulder and tilted her head at me expression Ernest all at once.
audio-7001.300-7003.300|Don't worry.
audio-7003.100-7005.200|She said I'm a big girl.
audio-7005.000-7012.300|She lives in one leg and kick the car door closed then took a few steps backward until she was under the entrance light again.
audio-7015.500-7028.300|And the next day off from the library and when I woke up I decided so all day just so when so music playing loud no room in my head for questions or thoughts just as I'd finished attaching the first lead to the road.
audio-7028.100-7033.500|There was a knock at my door followed by Jamie's voice from downstairs calling up to see if I was home.
audio-7033.300-7038.900|I looked around the room why I didn't want Jamie to see what I was making was a question.
audio-7038.700-7046.900|I hadn't posted myself, but I knew I didn't in a hurry I set the road down and started for the stairway where I could already hear her footsteps.
audio-7048.000-7057.200|Woman she was about halfway up and she didn't stop when she saw me I was on my way by so I figured I'd stop in if I don't get my haircut today.
audio-7057.000-7060.200|I swear I'll die better get it cut.
audio-7060.000-7066.300|Then I leaned against the wall in an effort to suggest that we can have our chat on the landing and then she could be on her way.
audio-7066.100-7071.500|She said I'm going to they're having a special at that place near Hilldale.
audio-7071.300-7077.800|She reached the top step and held out her Palm for mine want to come I touch my hair.
audio-7077.600-7084.600|I hadn't had it cut since the accident the ends were dry and splitting I shook my head broke.
audio-7084.400-7089.600|It was only half alive since I was feeling pinched from spending so much on the silk.
audio-7089.400-7093.800|She gave me an exasperated look, come on put it on your credit card.
audio-7093.600-7094.800|It won't kill you.
audio-7095.700-7099.500|I never use my credit card as a way of buying more than I could afford.
audio-7099.300-7107.000|My mother would warn me again and again about how quickly interest build how I'd end up paying double or more for everything.
audio-7106.800-7107.500|I bought.
audio-7107.300-7109.200|Sorry.
audio-7109.000-7111.700|I said I can't.
audio-7112.900-7120.800|Jamie turned a little and just that I was thinking she might actually leave she slapped her hand me once then step pass me through the doorway into my apartment.
audio-7120.600-7125.300|I've got to pee she said and then she stopped in their tracks.
audio-7126.900-7140.500|It was a site pieces of silk hanging from chair backs my table littered with pattern pieces pincushion links the ribbon my sewing machine sitting there with its little light bulb burning like a porch light on in the middle of the day.
audio-7141.300-7143.200|What is going on here?
audio-7143.000-7146.300|Jamie said I've been sewing.
audio-7147.100-7152.800|So I see but the question is what she Advanced where the table is this silk.
audio-7153.800-7158.200|It's a nightgown my voice sounded dead as Stone and I tried again.
audio-7158.000-7161.800|It's kind of a combo nightgown and robe.
audio-7162.500-7168.400|God carrying you didn't even tell me she reached for the Rogue which I'd left next the machine.
audio-7168.200-7172.000|Don't I heard past her to pick it up here?
audio-7171.800-7172.700|I'll show it to you.
audio-7173.500-7176.300|I forced myself to show her what I done so far.
audio-7176.100-7185.000|Then I carried the pieces into my bedroom took off what I was wearing and put the gown and then the Rope on quickly painting II sleeve into place.
audio-7185.800-7187.500|Totally amazing.
audio-7187.300-7191.400|She said from the doorway you could go into business and make a ton of money.
audio-7191.200-7194.000|I'm serious, right?
audio-7193.800-7205.700|I said, although I was flattered you could how much does a material cost a hundred 150 her eyes widened 200.
audio-7205.500-7210.800|She came over and felt the road still I bet you could charge 400 for the two pieces.
audio-7210.600-7212.800|Look at yourself.
audio-7212.600-7216.000|You look like some incredibly glamorous actress in an old movie.
audio-7215.800-7221.600|I turned and looked in the mirror, really Definitely.
audio-7221.400-7232.100|All you need is a cigarette in an ivory holder honeymoon City, ironically enough her eyes met mine in the mirror and we looked at each other for a long moment.
audio-7231.900-7234.200|Well, you never know.
audio-7234.000-7238.300|She said I do kind of nose thing.
audio-7239.000-7241.300|She turned from the mirror and stared at me.
audio-7241.100-7244.700|I was shaking with the shock of having set in for a while.
audio-7244.500-7253.800|I just stood there my face hot and my heart thudding then I turned around slick the robe off pulled again over my head and got back into my t-shirt and boxers.
audio-7254.500-7255.900|You're breaking up with him.
audio-7256.600-7262.600|I folded the gown in Tunis thorns and made a single vertical fold in the robe and laid it carefully on my bed.
audio-7262.400-7272.900|I didn't want to see the horror on her face again, but finally there was nothing else to do and I reluctantly turned and looked she was staring hard her mouth open.
audio-7274.200-7278.700|Oh my God, she said do you want to talk about it?
audio-7278.500-7280.200|I shook my head.
audio-7280.000-7282.600|She crossed the room instead of the window.
audio-7283.300-7284.800|I've been wondering what you were thinking.
audio-7284.600-7289.600|I mean I figured you were thinking about it, but I didn't know how you were feeling.
audio-7289.400-7293.100|I didn't know if you would go ahead and get married.
audio-7292.900-7298.800|Anyway, I mean, I knew that would be really hard and things weren't even so great before the accident.
audio-7298.600-7303.200|But all at once to turn to face me and I saw that she been fighting tears.
audio-7303.900-7306.400|God this is been so hard for you.
audio-7307.300-7308.800|Not as hard as for him.
audio-7309.600-7311.700|Yeah, but that almost makes it harder.
audio-7312.800-7318.600|I Shrugged it all at once the compassion on her face was gone replaced by Massive irritation.
audio-7318.400-7321.500|Terry went.
audio-7321.300-7325.500|I just have this weird feeling that I don't really know anyone anymore.
audio-7325.300-7327.700|Did I do something or you mad at me?
audio-7327.500-7328.900|Are you even in there?
audio-7328.700-7330.600|I turned away.
audio-7330.400-7332.300|It was a question.
audio-7332.100-7340.900|I understood because lately what I mainly thought was Halo as of the feelings I should be having Advantage II must be clanking around inside my own mind looking for them.
audio-7340.700-7342.300|I'm sorry.
audio-7342.100-7344.000|I said in a low voice.
audio-7345.100-7348.200|She came over to where I'm standing and touch the back of my shoulder.
audio-7348.000-7351.100|Then reached around me and hug me hard.
audio-7350.900-7352.700|Forget it.
audio-7352.500-7355.400|She said, I'm sorry.
audio-7355.200-7357.100|I shouldn't have said anything.
audio-7356.900-7358.300|I just wish I could help.
audio-7359.200-7362.700|She turned me around and I let her hug me from the front.
audio-7363.200-7364.800|When do you think you'll do it?
audio-7366.000-7366.900|I don't know.
audio-7366.700-7368.900|I'm pretty soon right.
audio-7368.700-7386.700|I mean don't you think you sort of should now that you've decided I guess I said, although I didn't really feel that I decided had chosen it was more as if I've been traveling somewhere unknown and I was there now looking around trying to get the lay of the land.
audio-7390.200-7403.200|I knew I should talk to Mike but 4 days I stumbled over the word, but I hope we'll always be friends, but I wish it didn't have to be this way, but I still love you but night after night.
audio-7403.000-7413.700|I sat with him held his hand and tried to interest him in something anything and all the while I was rapped by my own silent voice picking over words looking for some that would serve.
audio-7414.400-7417.900|One evening, John Junior came to the hospital with mrs. Mayor.
audio-7417.700-7419.200|He seems nervous.
audio-7419.000-7423.600|He started telling like about the new hockey coach and almost immediately.
audio-7423.400-7426.200|I felt this familiar Sliding Away Mike's attention.
audio-7427.300-7430.300|Mom interrupted John at one point.
audio-7430.100-7434.500|I thought you were bringing a new Sports Illustrated tonight a little later.
audio-7434.300-7441.100|He asked me for a drink of water moments after that a Kleenex John stood up in the middle of a sentence and walked out of the room.
audio-7440.900-7442.600|Where is he going?
audio-7442.400-7445.800|Mike said I was leaning against the wall.
audio-7445.600-7449.800|And when he looked at me, I Shrugged a little you were kind of ignoring him.

audio-7534.700-7535.500|You're different.
audio-7535.300-7538.500|He looked me in the eye and then quickly looked away.
audio-7538.300-7539.800|I don't know.
audio-7539.600-7541.000|I don't know what's wrong with me.

audio-7552.800-7556.600|He smiled, you know what I was thinking about the other day.
audio-7557.500-7558.600|I'm at that party.

audio-7568.500-7573.200|Then everyone was in that little room he closed his eyes inside.
audio-7574.000-7575.200|What made you think of that?
audio-7576.600-7577.700|I don't know.

audio-7578.900-7581.100|What is eyes met mine?

audio-7592.800-7599.000|I hesitated this was the edge the opening I've been looking for but I couldn't bear to use it.
audio-7598.800-7604.800|I don't know I said I really don't it's okay.
audio-7604.600-7607.500|He said you don't have to feel bad.
audio-7608.400-7612.100|We can't have this conversation right now your mother and John will be back any minute.
audio-7611.900-7613.700|He licked his lips.
audio-7613.500-7618.400|We've had it having me know please.
audio-7619.500-7622.300|He gave me a look of piercing quietude.
audio-7622.100-7624.200|It's a release me.
audio-7624.000-7629.200|Actually, he said I was really tired of wondering Mike.
audio-7629.000-7632.200|He moved his arm pulled it closer to his body.
audio-7632.000-7633.100|I stop talking.
audio-7632.900-7636.700|He looked at the arm onto his lap his hand dragging behind.
audio-7637.800-7642.900|Let's not he said, okay, let's just now.
audio-7644.600-7645.400|At home.
audio-7645.200-7656.000|I filled my tub with hot water and took a long bath at least soaking for a long time waiting to be filled by tears and terrible regret or by release whatever it would be.
audio-7656.800-7659.800|I lay and lay and waited and waited.
audio-7659.600-7669.500|But all I could think all I could feel was that I was tired if an error of my life had ended its passing was remarkable.
audio-7669.300-7681.900|Only for The Quiet Left Behind The Whisper of myself asking myself what there was now That I knew I'd ride off and dressed and clean jeans and a sweatshirt and made a pot of coffee.
audio-7681.700-7685.000|It was almost 10, but that didn't faze me.
audio-7684.800-7691.200|I'd Mark the robes hemline the day before I had four yards to so but I didn't feel daunted.
audio-7691.000-7696.200|I took the road to a chair near bright light threaded a needle and got started.
audio-7697.300-7704.300|When I finish my body ached, I undressed and slipped on the ground in the robe in my bedroom mirror.
audio-7704.100-7714.300|I did look glamorous as Jamie had said but only from the neck down because my face was all wrong too serious to plane too young.
audio-7715.000-7717.000|It was nearly 1 in the morning.
audio-7716.800-7717.100|Now.
audio-7716.900-7721.200|I got dressed and went back out to the living room where I put everything away.
audio-7721.000-7730.400|I unplug the sewing machine and put the cover on I said it by the door then I went into my bedroom and got out the enormous old suitcase.
audio-7730.200-7731.400|My mother had lent me.
audio-7732.200-7733.300|Working quickly.
audio-7733.100-7738.100|I filled it was closed and when I'd finished my dresser and closet, we're nearly empty.
audio-7738.800-7743.100|Last and wear the gown and robe folded carefully and wrapped in tissue paper.
audio-7744.200-7751.800|I found a smaller hole doll for my toiletries and a few other odds and ends and I carried both bags down to my car.
audio-7751.600-7762.500|I went back up for a last look around and feed half a gallon of milk into the sink took out the garbage and return for my sewing machine and then I locked up.
audio-7763.600-7765.200|How much do we owe the people?
audio-7765.000-7768.200|We love how much do we owe them?
audio-7768.000-7770.000|But I was in high school.
audio-7769.800-7774.700|Something people said in Praise of their friends was he put his hand in the fire for me.
audio-7774.500-7780.400|I think Mike may have even said it about rooster once and it's just possible rooster.
audio-7780.200-7785.000|What is put his hand in the fire for Mike given up his hand.
audio-7785.700-7789.900|What I discovered was that I couldn't give up my life for Mike.
audio-7789.700-7791.900|That's how I saw it at the time.
audio-7791.700-7793.000|That's the choice.
audio-7792.800-7796.700|I thought I had to make and because I couldn't give up everything.
audio-7796.500-7799.400|I also thought I couldn't give up anything.
audio-7799.200-7803.300|There's a kind of tired you can get that has its own energy.
audio-7803.100-7809.800|I was exhausted when I started the car my eyes stinging in my back and neck aching.
audio-7809.600-7814.700|But once I was driving I discovered that I was actually in no real danger of falling asleep.
audio-7815.700-7822.000|I took I-90 down pass Chicago and saw the sunrise just as I was passing like Michigan.
audio-7821.800-7828.800|It was a clear day and soon the states were going by as if they were towns built close together by the side of the highway.
audio-7828.600-7837.700|I thought occasionally of stopping but I was in the rhythm of it and I kept going Find me somewhere in eastern, Pennsylvania.
audio-7837.500-7842.700|I got off and found a motel and slept by mid-morning.
audio-7842.500-7845.700|I was back on the road at 1 gas station.
audio-7845.500-7853.100|I bought a map and that another I found the Manhattan phone book and located the address of Biggs leper Rush Creighton in Fenelon.
audio-7852.900-7856.100|The Helpful nickname perfectly clear in my mind.
audio-7857.100-7861.400|Then versus the morning clouds were sitting in the sky was turning blue.
audio-7861.200-7870.200|I steered my way onto the George Washington Bridge and there was New York stretching down the river as far as I could see.
audio-7873.600-7882.600|Simon lives on the edge of Chelsea in a decrepit old Brownstone with taped over windows in a sheet of graffiti plywood covering front door.
audio-7883.300-7890.600|Simon and some yellow friends occupied for bedrooms, but he found me an empty Alcove on the third floor and together.
audio-7890.400-7894.000|We dragged to spare futon up the Steep creaking stairs.
audio-7895.200-7898.100|He kept apologizing about the place but I liked it.
audio-7897.900-7907.700|It was so shabby and easy going there was a dark cavernous living room that the kitchen was the true center of the house the place where everyone hung out.
audio-7908.400-7924.400|At least a couple stereos were usually playing and it was a little like living in a dorm again people coming and going at all hours the sound of a door closing waking me just as I'd fallen asleep Simon's friends were perfectly nice, but they were also ambitious.
audio-7924.200-7935.100|I felt like a misfit Santa was a proofreader, but wanted to be an illustrator one friend was a waiter, but wanted to be an actor another work to the magazine, but wanted to be a playwright.
audio-7934.900-7940.700|My ambition was to have an ambition until I found Kilroy.
audio-7941.500-7944.200|That I did stay in, New York.
audio-7945.200-7949.000|I left his note Madison, but I brought our conversation.
audio-7948.800-7964.400|I brought our conversation and the intent way he looked at me across Viktor and ania's table and the name of the bar where he hung out the place with a pool table that had a gouge that he could almost always make work for him mclanahan's.
audio-7965.100-7967.000|A few days after my arrival.
audio-7966.800-7971.300|I sat at the kitchen table with the Manhattan white pages and looked up the address.
audio-7972.500-7981.200|It was on Avenue of the Americas 6th Avenue, which according to my map and narrowed it down to about 60 blocks none the less.
audio-7981.000-7985.500|I had it off to look still such a newcomer that the traffic unnerved me.
audio-7985.300-7992.500|The groaning buses the scream of an ambulance The Flash and hunk of a dozen taxis.
audio-7993.300-7998.800|The density of people on the streets and Maze me the density in the variety.
audio-7998.600-8009.900|I always thought Madison was pretty Multicultural, but it was clear now how white it really was I saw faces from Olive to deep Brown heard accents.
audio-8009.700-8027.200|I didn't recognize language is I couldn't begin to identify my past restaurants pharmacies laundromat stationers florist liquor stores coffee shops, and then suddenly there was mcclanahan's a corner bar next to a dry cleaners.
audio-8028.000-8031.300|What did it mean that I done this track this place down?
audio-8031.100-8034.400|I hurried by telling myself a story.
audio-8034.200-8039.500|I have believed that I was just exploring City and could as easily have been somewhere else?
audio-8040.800-8042.400|I was back the next day.
audio-8042.200-8051.600|There were neon beer signs of the windows Miller and Pabst good Midwestern beers, but hear the windows were covered by iron bars.
audio-8052.300-8064.200|I went around the block slowly wondering what I do when I got back to stretch from 7th to 6th seemed endless a dark narrow passageway of tall grey buildings.
audio-8064.800-8075.000|I'm not rich mcclanahan's again and someone open the door just as I arrived revealing a long narrow room that was smoke-filled and dimly lit and nearly empty.
audio-8075.800-8076.900|I'm third day.
audio-8076.700-8083.900|I planted myself out front the door to mclanahan's was massive ornamented with tarnished brass studs.
audio-8083.700-8092.300|I said they're waiting for something to take over the urge to leave or the urge to go in 5 minutes went by Propst and I didn't keep track.
audio-8092.100-8096.700|I stared at the door until virtually conjured.
audio-8096.500-8099.000|Kilroy himself came out.
audio-8098.800-8105.800|He looks older than I remembered wearing jeans and a leather jacket his face narrow enclosed.
audio-8105.600-8109.600|His hair was Shaggy and he sported a two or three-day growth of beard.
audio-8110.400-8113.700|He glanced at me and turn the corner then stopped and turned back.
audio-8113.500-8121.000|I know you he said and I smiled a little feeling foolish and pleased and scared.
audio-8120.800-8127.600|He pointed Madison Wisconsin dinner at that polish couples house.
audio-8127.400-8128.300|How's it going?
audio-8129.000-8130.100|Fine, how are you?
audio-8129.900-8132.200|I'm fine Terry.
audio-8133.000-8141.700|I can't believe he remembered my name after what 3 months but he just gave me a Sly smile and went on no.
audio-8141.500-8145.100|Don't tell me I'm going for broke here Carey.
audio-8146.500-8152.400|Belle what's a nice Midwestern girl like you doing in Big Bad Manhattan?
audio-8153.100-8155.000|What makes you so sure I'm nice.
audio-8154.800-8158.000|You got it written all over you.
audio-8157.800-8160.900|It's right there on your face next to sweet and good.
audio-8160.700-8169.300|I thought of what I done went out in the middle of the night on people who counted on me and I felt shaky suddenly ready to cry.
audio-8169.100-8173.100|I haven't called anyone in Madison had no idea.
audio-8172.900-8173.800|What was going through.
audio-8173.600-8177.500|My mother's head Jamie's Mike's.
audio-8178.300-8179.200|Oops.
audio-8179.000-8182.000|He said I sent the story.
audio-8181.800-8185.200|Can I buy you a beer or do you want to Pretend This Never Happened?
audio-8185.000-8186.300|We never ran into each other.
audio-8187.100-8187.800|Sure.
audio-8187.600-8189.900|I said to him all the beer.
audio-8191.000-8194.500|That first day we talked for 4 hours or rather.
audio-8194.300-8202.500|I talked I told him all about the summer the jerky slip-slide in my feelings the weeks and weeks of it and has since leaving.
audio-8202.300-8220.700|I've been on the speedway careening from guilt or remorse relief to xhilaration with New York standing right outside at all, massive impassive just there and their I even told him about the last night with Mike his we've had it have a way.
audio-8221.400-8234.100|In a way, I waved him from the door as I was leaving a finger waggle a light entirely untruthful wiggle of the fingers of my right hand as if either of us had any idea what we expected next let alone what would actually happen.
audio-8235.000-8236.200|You flew the coop.
audio-8236.000-8246.600|Tell her I said yeah to we're sitting on a bench in Washington Square Park by then the night black and heavy around us a pair of pigeons bobbing at our feet.
audio-8246.400-8248.700|I think it was Brave of you.
audio-8248.500-8251.800|He went on a must have been a very hard thing to do.
audio-8251.600-8255.300|He turns that he was facing me one knee up on the bench.
audio-8255.900-8260.300|Harder than stain stain felt impossible.
audio-8260.100-8264.300|Yeah, but staying with static you acted.
audio-8264.100-8271.400|I admire it I was surprised and for the first time since we've begun talk and I felt self-conscious.
audio-8272.500-8277.300|Kilroy Grint you can't believe you're talking to me like this when you don't really know me.
audio-8277.100-8280.500|I don't really know you I said with a laugh.
audio-8280.300-8284.400|I don't know you would all he looked at one shoulder.
audio-8284.200-8291.100|What's knowing someone you may not know where I grew up for what I do from 9 to 5 every day, but you know what?
audio-8290.900-8292.600|It's like to be with me for several hours.
audio-8292.400-8295.600|Doesn't that tell you more than information one?
audio-8295.400-8300.200|I guess I said, but I was thinking what did you grow up?
audio-8300.000-8303.700|What do you do for 9 to 5 each day drink.
audio-8303.500-8305.400|He looked at me and laughed.

audio-8307.500-8312.500|Okay, easy one first I said is Kilroy your first or last name?

audio-8319.000-8321.400|There's no Kilroy in there at all.
audio-8321.200-8322.400|It's just been called.
audio-8322.200-8326.100|Why because it's not in there at all.
audio-8327.000-8331.100|Score one Kilroy I thought all right.
audio-8330.900-8332.800|Where did you grow up?
audio-8333.700-8338.800|smocking lifted a finger to his lips I didn't don't tell.
audio-8339.500-8349.100|Paul Elliott Fraser the evasive I said and he gave me a big smile that lasted and lasted a smile that anointed me New York.
audio-8348.900-8352.400|He said born-and-bred thing.
audio-8352.200-8354.600|I do from 9 to 5 is I work for a temp agency.
audio-8354.400-8363.500|I get hired at some businesses you need a week or two of word processing done because someone's on vacation or I go answer the phone while someone sick.
audio-8363.300-8365.700|I'm a Ramblin Man of office work.
audio-8365.500-8366.800|I never stay anywhere very long.
audio-8366.600-8372.100|I put that dictaphone behind me and saddle up to the subway ride to The Copier on the horizon.
audio-8373.100-8383.000|I smile but I was surprised I figured you was a struggling something-or-other like Simon and his friends maybe was a struggling something-or-other and just wasn't saying.
audio-8383.900-8384.800|Happy now.
audio-8384.600-8387.500|He said so you know me a whole lot better.
audio-8387.300-8393.400|I listed one shoulder to your parents to live in the city if you could call it living.
audio-8394.300-8395.600|It was getting to his feet.
audio-8395.400-8404.500|So I stood too and all at once everyone stood with me like Jamie rooster even my mother everyone I've been talkin about.
audio-8404.300-8408.900|Why did I have such a crowd along when Kilroy was so obviously by himself.
audio-8408.700-8421.600|Shall we he said We enter the park 3 opening on the side, but we went out past the arch at once massive and curious the ghostly against the night sky.
audio-8422.500-8430.300|Is my first time on Lower Fifth Avenue when I walk with my head tilted back the skylon jagged with roofs and let Windows far ahead.
audio-8430.100-8433.000|The Empire State Building was limned with white lights.
audio-8432.800-8434.700|Do you like to walk?
audio-8434.500-8440.000|He said that's good New York is Walker City.
audio-8439.800-8441.300|That's the only way to get to know it.
audio-8441.900-8452.100|We turn onto 14th Street and one pass faded storefront sent any bodegas crowded with men a police car with his red and blue lights swirling shriek past us and turn at the far corner.
audio-8452.800-8454.300|I love Sirens.
audio-8454.100-8457.600|Kilroy said the sound of them especially at 9.
audio-8457.400-8459.300|I looked at him.
audio-8459.900-8460.800|I do.
audio-8460.600-8464.200|My bedroom is an especially good listening point for Sirens.
audio-8464.000-8471.400|It's got my only window on 7th Avenue will see I stopped walking and he stopped to and smiled at me.
audio-8472.200-8475.800|I'll see I said I'll see your bedroom.
audio-8476.500-8478.100|He shook his head Gravely.
audio-8477.900-8480.700|Don't be offended by the truth Terry.
audio-8480.500-8482.200|That's an untenable position.

audio-8507.900-8510.300|Just inside the front door of his apartment.
audio-8510.100-8517.600|Really one long kiss interrupted by conversation by the need to keep moving until we were here.
audio-8518.600-8519.600|We were here.
audio-8520.500-8527.500|He kiss me again and then trace the line for my throat to the top of my jeans and back up to the clasp of my bra.
audio-8528.300-8539.200|My breast fell out and he opened his hand to spend them his thumb on one nipple and his little finger on the other tiny circles and then he stroked down the under curves.
audio-8539.000-8556.800|I tried closing my eyes, but his hands came up to my face thumbs up my lashes and I had to look again had to see that it was he Kilroy eyes Dark & grey blue black banded flecked with a color of the sky.
audio-8557.700-8569.500|His thin lips Kris at the tip of his nose his narrow hands and his long fingers on my shoulders now pushing the sweater off the bra straps.
audio-8570.200-8595.600|I had to yank to untuck his shirt a stiff denim 11 shirt tail and then the other and then the warm underneath the hair on his belly and chest my fingertips plowing through it raking up and down around down into the back of his jeans tight all the way down into each hand was full of buttock my fingers just the tops of his legs finding the lines of sweat.
audio-8596.200-8619.100|Can button his own shirt toss it for the dresser held me skin-to-skin his hands alive on my back coming around under my arms thumbs on my nipple mouth mouth the bed coming up under me zippers jeans and then suddenly the room the apartment the world my face my hands.

audio-8626.200-8633.400|I was I pulled the sheet aside the we're doing this of it sweeping the fan out of the way.
audio-8634.200-8645.300|And I close my eyes and felt him hard against my leg satin a softness of it against my thigh pushing to get in and then it was this.
audio-8645.100-8646.900|Yes.
audio-8647.900-8655.400|no, urine, strange old and new me and not me.
audio-8657.700-8665.200|It was all I wanted to do morning and night at dusk when he just gotten home from work early on a weekend afternoon.
audio-8665.000-8671.900|I came up behind him and circled his waist with my arms and slide my hands down the front of his pants.
audio-8671.700-8681.600|He was at the sink washing dishes when I did this or he was on his couch and I went straight for his crotch meeting the fun of his dreams until he was so swollen.
audio-8681.400-8684.700|I had to press myself against him right then.
audio-8685.400-8686.600|Outside his apartment.
audio-8686.400-8690.100|We hardly touched no holding hands on the street.
audio-8689.900-8701.400|No legs coming together Under restaurant tables if we were meeting at mcclanahan's we met without a kiss so that it all stayed in the air between us ignitable but not ignited.
audio-8702.200-8705.400|The world was different because of this sky was a blue.
audio-8705.200-8725.700|I'd never seen before hard and cold with edges that could cut smells emanating from restaurants attached themselves to individual ingredients with startling specificity melted butter grilling lamb cumin in tomatoes cilantro frying salmon.
audio-8726.900-8749.600|We're at mclanahan's a lot drinking beers at a table near the back or sitting at the bar when the place wasn't so crowded Kilroys saying that guy needs an appointment at a methadone clinic yesterday or watch now she's going to tilt their head sideways to wear Diamond here and we'll show and she whoever she was would do just that you're an observer, aren't you?
audio-8749.400-8750.900|I said one evening.
audio-8750.700-8759.900|You should be a journalist go-round with little tape recorder you talk into and you can write these reports about you know life in the city.
audio-8760.500-8761.900|He shook his head.
audio-8761.700-8774.600|But with a smile see there it is right there what the pernicious little idea that who you are should determine something as trivial as what you do for a living as trivial.
audio-8774.400-8779.200|He shook his head again life's don't like that something malleable.
audio-8779.000-8780.600|It's not that need.
audio-8780.400-8785.500|He looked at his beer and took a long drink and wipe the cuff of his sweatshirt across his mouth.
audio-8786.000-8795.000|With that theory to have to be one of those career graduate students going from PhD to PhD I left what's that supposed to mean?
audio-8794.800-8795.900|I'm a nerd.
audio-8795.700-8798.800|I was referring to your inquisitiveness.
audio-8799.800-8805.300|My face warm then I looked away the night before I got in going with questions.
audio-8805.100-8820.300|We were in bed entwined after sex and I'd asked about his last girlfriend who how long what happens and he became unhealthy, but cool not even cool so much is absent.
audio-8820.100-8822.400|It was like he suddenly wasn't there.
audio-8823.100-8825.700|Alan mcclanahan's I felt his eyes on me.
audio-8825.500-8827.700|I was looking to the side.
audio-8827.500-8832.900|I watched a guy in a blue and white striped dress shirt moving around the pool table.
audio-8832.700-8840.400|He gather the balls from a low shelf and began arranging them in a plastic triangle something about him.
audio-8840.200-8847.300|He had Mike shoulders that was it the exact span of them their growth in a dress shirt.
audio-8847.100-8856.300|He looks nothing like Mike older balding with a long all of complected face, but the shoulders my God.
audio-8856.100-8858.900|I was dizzy suddenly queasy with remorse.
audio-8858.700-8863.400|I couldn't stand to think of Mike lying in his hospital bed.
audio-8863.200-8866.800|Wondering where I done each time the door open each time.
audio-8866.600-8868.700|The phone rang is that carry?
audio-8868.500-8872.800|I mentioned his face the bars of the Halo framing is hopefulness.
audio-8872.600-8877.700|And then The Dashing of Hope when he learned to it really was Help me.
audio-8878.800-8879.700|Never me.
audio-8879.500-8885.600|I've been gone two weeks 3 and he had no idea what it happened to me.
audio-8886.200-8887.100|No one did.
audio-8887.900-8889.500|Finally, I called my mother.
audio-8889.300-8893.600|I was sure she'd be upset maybe angry when she heard my voice.
audio-8893.400-8899.300|She just said hi very evenly as if we'd spoken only the day before.
audio-8900.400-8901.500|I'm in New York.
audio-8901.300-8904.600|I said staying with a high-school friend.
audio-8904.400-8906.800|Remember Simon who you met that night.
audio-8906.600-8913.500|I just I needed to change I needed to get out of there and she said I know.
audio-8914.400-8922.800|There been phone calls trips to look up at my apartment Windows reports on my last visit with Mike, but she said she'd never been worried.
audio-8922.600-8923.500|Really.
audio-8923.300-8926.800|She figured I'd done just about exactly what I don't know.
audio-8926.600-8928.600|How are you doing?
audio-8928.400-8930.800|She said do you need any money?
audio-8930.600-8932.400|I'm okay.
audio-8932.200-8932.900|Thanks.
audio-8932.700-8941.400|I had some savings at home about $1,500 so I couldn't quite see running through it just to Dalian York I doing here.
audio-8941.200-8943.500|Anyway, how long was I going to stay?
audio-8944.600-8948.800|How do you feel she said I feel guilty.
audio-8948.600-8951.300|What does it say about me that I leave?
audio-8951.100-8952.900|What kind of person does it make me?
audio-8953.600-8955.500|She didn't reply for a moment.
audio-8955.300-8961.600|I felt a long span between us the miles and miles of wire at last she spoke.
audio-8962.300-8963.600|Kind of person you are.
audio-8964.500-9001.800|A Rush of laughter escape to me but it makes you the kind of person you are people had this idea that what they do changes who they are a married man has an affair anything's now I've become a bad person as if something had changed meaning you already was a bad person meaning bad isn't the issue meaning you do what you do and without consequences for other people, of course, sometimes very grave ones, but it's not very helpful to regard your choices as a series of right or wrong moves.
audio-9001.600-9004.500|They don't Define you as much as you define them.
audio-9005.100-9007.000|You're sounding very mystical.
audio-9006.800-9010.200|I said are you saying it was my destiny to leave?
audio-9010.000-9011.600|Not at all?
audio-9011.400-9019.200|You could just as easily have stayed but that would make you a good person anymore than leaving makes you a bad one already made honey.
audio-9019.000-9019.800|That's what I mean.
audio-9020.600-9024.800|And whose fault is that I joked surprisingly comforted.
audio-9024.600-9028.500|I take credit for everything except your big feet.
audio-9028.300-9035.000|We both laughed and then suddenly I felt conscious of another presence almost as if someone were listening on the extension.
audio-9036.200-9037.900|I wonder what he'd say.
audio-9037.700-9040.200|I said your father.
audio-9040.000-9041.800|My mother said without missing a beat.
audio-9041.600-9059.000|What do you think we talked for awhile more and it wasn't until later until we hung up and I'd climb the stairs to my Dusty Alcove at the idea of my father came back to me together with the words to an old Paul Simon song had heard on the radio somewhere in Western, Pennsylvania.
audio-9058.800-9061.400|What would my father say?
audio-9062.500-9066.200|Jump on a ferry carry just set yourself free.
audio-9067.100-9081.400|It was almost funny until it occurred to me that perhaps would have been his voice all along since my earliest feeling that something between me and Mike was wrong perhaps it had been his voice all along the saying go you don't need this.
audio-9081.200-9083.600|Nothing's making you stay.
audio-9084.300-9090.300|Disco It was he now I hadn't given it any thought in years.
audio-9090.100-9101.400|He was a Midwestern are born and bred in growing up in a small town in Minnesota lived for a while with relatives and I will after his parents died then gone to Madison for college.
audio-9101.200-9109.500|I don't always figured he was somewhere in the midwest, but what if he wound up in New York what if I happened to pass month Street one day would you look familiar?
audio-9109.300-9113.900|Would you be gray-haired folding fat thin?
audio-9113.700-9115.800|What do you recognize me?
audio-9115.600-9119.400|Could you pass a relative on the street and feel nothing?
audio-9121.700-9126.700|It was a few more days before I called Mike and by then word had reached him as I known.
audio-9126.500-9133.900|It would I can almost see it word flying across Madison burning the phone wires.
audio-9134.800-9137.000|Hey, it's carry the city slicker.
audio-9136.800-9140.000|He said when he heard my voice, New York.
audio-9140.700-9144.800|I picture him in his hospital bed that had raised his face winter pale.
audio-9144.600-9147.100|I said, I'm sorry.
audio-9146.900-9148.000|I haven't called.
audio-9147.800-9148.500|I'm sorry.
audio-9148.300-9149.600|I just disappeared.
audio-9149.400-9151.000|No problem.
audio-9150.800-9153.000|He said cheerfully New York.
audio-9152.800-9153.700|Sounds like fun.
audio-9153.500-9154.800|You must be having a great time.
audio-9155.600-9158.400|My throat felt full and I force myself to swallow.
audio-9158.200-9160.000|It's pretty amazing.
audio-9161.000-9163.100|So you're hanging out with Simon guy?
audio-9163.800-9174.100|I thought of Kilroy with whom I'd woken up that morning who's woken me up pressing his erection against my bare thigh his hand on my side.
audio-9174.900-9181.100|Yeah, it's it's Mike Simon and his housemates will just promise you won't get weird.
audio-9180.900-9183.300|Okay, we need weird.
audio-9183.100-9186.300|Oh, you know pretentious jaded.
audio-9186.100-9187.600|Okay.
audio-9187.400-9192.700|I said with the laugh we talked for a little longer about nothing.
audio-9192.500-9202.400|Certainly not about how long I'd stay away or about what is anything we still meant to each other you sounded so happy better than he had in ages.
audio-9203.400-9204.800|Well have fun.
audio-9204.600-9206.500|He said his we were about to hang up.
audio-9206.300-9208.800|Send me a postcard of the Empire State Building.
audio-9208.600-9209.300|Okay?
audio-9210.200-9211.200|We said goodbye.
audio-9212.300-9220.600|Simon was in his room, but I grabbed a jacket and headed to Kilroy's hurrying on the darker cross streets in the vestibule of his building.
audio-9220.400-9230.600|I ran my finger down the road Tiny still buttons until I found his He buzzed me up and met me at the door to his apartment a book closed around his index finger.
audio-9230.400-9246.500|He pulled me in and then Back Bay against the closed-door, his face was warm and Scratchy said they're kissing for a while and then I pulled away and told him about the call about how Mike it sounded as if he'd meant what he said in his hospital room tonight.
audio-9246.300-9249.900|I left that he was glad he didn't have to wonder about us anymore.
audio-9250.900-9256.500|Do what she sounded more upset or worried said we're in the living room now standing near his couch.
audio-9256.300-9258.700|We didn't quite know how to sit together yet.
audio-9258.500-9260.200|His thumbs were in his belt.
audio-9260.000-9262.700|Loops hand splayed over his front pockets.
audio-9263.300-9269.400|Not more upset I said, but then I broke off talking Kilroy tilted his head to the side.
audio-9269.200-9271.000|Tell me.
audio-9271.700-9277.100|I breathe in deeply and looked at him his shirt features and shaggy hair.
audio-9278.100-9279.000|Tell me.
audio-9279.600-9288.700|They meant something those words it meant he wanted to know he stood there looking at me a watchful interested expression on his face.
audio-9289.700-9291.600|I hope I didn't want him to be upset.
audio-9291.400-9298.300|I began I mean all summer suddenly tears search for my eyes.
audio-9299.600-9301.100|I didn't want to hurt him.
audio-9300.900-9304.400|I cried but sometimes sitting there with him.
audio-9304.200-9308.500|I felt like I was watching myself sitting there with him, like look at her.
audio-9308.300-9310.000|She's doing the right thing.
audio-9309.800-9318.600|I felt so distant Kilroy not and thoughtfully and now I've left and I mean, what does it mean to him?
audio-9318.400-9321.200|He rubbed his chin and considered.
audio-9322.100-9323.600|You don't want him to be upset.
audio-9323.400-9327.200|He said but you want him to be thinking about it.
audio-9328.700-9340.100|I was at I wanted him to be thinking about it just as I was thinking about it, but I had this to I had talking about it with someone I'd be in bed with before long.
audio-9339.900-9344.000|It was too much the overlapping this of it.
audio-9343.800-9351.500|All Mike's feelings in my feelings and Kilroy taking my hands and pulling it toward his mouth.
audio-9353.900-9369.600|Leather jackets and stretchy pants square-toed, boots and fedoras skinny Nets and clear plastic purses fashion was everywhere and I was entranced walking around.
audio-9369.400-9399.900|I got so involved in looking at other women that I began bumping into people stopped at crosswalks, excuse me and say that I check out their outfits when afternoon, I found a fabric storage is under the wing of Carnegie Hall outside taxis blared and buses hist but the store itself was quiet an urban version of Fabrications run by a Phalanx of heavy besuited sells ladies who watched worthlessly from behind the cutting tables as I strolled around.
audio-9400.800-9412.100|There were hundreds of bolts of Fabrics on shelves running to the high ceiling silk prints and your cards pan velvets with swirls of gold and silver soft wool.
audio-9411.900-9413.600|So full of metal color.
audio-9413.400-9414.700|They conjured places.
audio-9414.500-9420.000|I've never been that Heather and Scottish Highlands the emerald flecked gray of the Irish Countryside.
audio-9419.800-9436.900|I long to buy something just some small thing and I was feeling hopeless until I remembered when I slept at The Brownstone instead of at Kilroy's a small window in the stairwell that have wide band of light into my Alcove and woke me up broke or not.
audio-9436.700-9438.800|I could spend $5 to make a curtain.
audio-9438.600-9439.600|Good night.
audio-9440.600-9445.800|I found an inexpensive off white cotton and with a feeling that I was getting away with something.
audio-9445.600-9446.900|I bought a single yard.
audio-9447.800-9448.700|That evening.
audio-9448.500-9454.500|I set up my sewing machine in The Brownstone kitchen and got to work till red come to keep me company.
audio-9454.300-9468.600|And as I pinned the ambled around the room looking at things a days old copy of the times New Yorker missing its cover a whiteboard or someone had written Craig Steven Spielberg calls you not.
audio-9469.300-9478.200|Greg's the wannabe actor Kilroy said I looked up for my work and nodded he uncap the marker and wrote Steven Spielberg.
audio-9478.000-9483.300|But is he an artist and he glanced at me and might get off leaving a blue smear?
audio-9483.100-9487.400|Oh, well, he said guess I shouldn't offend the natives.
audio-9488.100-9501.100|I hadn't really thought about how it would feel to have him at the Brownstone son was the only one he met and when I asked hilroy afterward what he thought of Simon he hemmed and hawed and then said he thought Simon was trying to be something he wasn't.
audio-9500.900-9502.300|Well.
audio-9502.100-9502.500|Yeah.
audio-9502.300-9506.800|I said he's trying to be an illustrator, but he just shook his head.
audio-9507.800-9518.600|I heard the front door open and in a moment Simon and Greg came in the kitchen both dresses if they've been out somewhere special in nice shirts and jackets and even surprisingly ties.
audio-9519.400-9524.800|Your sewing Simon said loosening the knot in his tie and unbuttoning the top button of shirt.
audio-9524.600-9527.600|What are you feeling the call of the Midwest?
audio-9527.400-9530.900|It's the call of the early morning son.
audio-9530.700-9534.200|I said piercing The Alcove and waking me up too early.
audio-9534.000-9537.000|I'm making curtain for the window in the stairwell.
audio-9536.800-9538.700|He smiled.
audio-9538.500-9540.900|I guess that would make sense.
audio-9540.700-9543.400|If you ever he glanced to Kilroy.
audio-9543.200-9545.400|Oh nevermind.
audio-9545.200-9547.200|Have you met Kilroy?
audio-9547.000-9551.200|I said quickly to Greg looking back and forth between the two of them.
audio-9552.000-9554.200|Greg had been standing near the sink now.
audio-9554.000-9556.600|He came forward and offered kelroy his hand.
audio-9557.300-9561.400|So Kerry Simon said we were just at this party.
audio-9561.200-9563.000|I swear you would have died.
audio-9562.800-9563.700|This guy.
audio-9563.500-9565.400|Jason is friend of ours from Yale.
audio-9565.200-9574.700|His father is the heir to a New England Apartments to our fortune and have his annual party every October to I don't know celebrate their wealth or whatever.
audio-9574.500-9585.300|Anyway, this is Newport Avenue duplex and they have eight bathrooms Greg said and in my peripheral vision, I saw Kilroy Bridal, what does that even mean?
audio-9585.100-9590.000|He said I could fit 8 bathrooms in my apartment still have room for my lazy boy.
audio-9589.800-9592.200|You don't have a lazy boy.
audio-9592.000-9594.800|I interjected trying for light tone.
audio-9594.600-9596.600|So I was nervous all at once.
audio-9597.300-9598.500|He snapped his fingers.
audio-9598.300-9599.400|Damn.
audio-9599.200-9600.100|I better get one.
audio-9599.900-9601.700|He turned to Simon.
audio-9601.500-9605.300|I live in the kind of place where a lazy boy would add character.
audio-9605.100-9618.500|Well anyway, Simon said carry this party perrier-jouet and I mean cases waiters passing Little smoked salmon, deeley's tiny filo pastries Etc flowers.
audio-9618.300-9626.000|Like you wouldn't believe Jason's father is in the Forbes 400 Greg said and Kilroy gave him and look of disdain.
audio-9625.800-9628.300|You mean he has a lot of money.
audio-9628.100-9645.800|Well, yeah Greg said obviously like hundreds of thousands like a millions and millions of exclaimed Jason used to get driven up to school in a limousine really tell her I said was it by chances stretch limousine?
audio-9646.200-9651.200|Greg blushed after moment he put his hands in his pockets and pull them out again.
audio-9651.000-9656.100|Well Simon said on that note, I think I'll go watch TV.
audio-9655.900-9670.500|He made a face the sort of ironically freaked out face that was meant to say he actually was freaked out and then he left the kitchen my face was burning I bent over the sewing machine in lower the needle into the fabric poor Greg.
audio-9670.300-9674.600|He's never been anything but nice to me and now my boyfriend was making him look like a fool.
audio-9674.400-9679.900|What was Kilmer's problem wasn't Greg for the subject of people with money.
audio-9679.700-9692.000|I noticed this before it was as if Kilroy were Frugal not by me, but to make a point the same point made by the N word fergality that catches walls empty of pictures his floors bear.
audio-9692.500-9695.800|It was a frugality that said I don't need anything.
audio-9696.700-9703.800|And I wondered where does that leave me Greg came and Stood Beside Me and looked down at my work too bad.
audio-9703.600-9705.100|We don't have another room for you.
audio-9704.900-9707.700|I feel pretty lucky to have the Alcove.
audio-9707.500-9711.400|Yeah, but it must be frustrating to know Alice has never even in a room.
audio-9712.200-9714.800|Alice and the room on the other side of the wall for me.
audio-9714.600-9716.400|I'd only seen her a few times.
audio-9716.200-9719.600|She spend most of her time at her boyfriend's place in the East Village.
audio-9719.400-9728.500|I guess I'll head upstairs to he said nice to meet you said to Kilroy's he left and Kilroy lifted his chin and smiled.
audio-9728.300-9729.600|You too.
audio-9730.800-9732.300|Alone again with him.
audio-9732.100-9736.900|I turned back to my sewing and I heard and pick up the newspaper a little later.
audio-9736.700-9742.500|I heard a step and looked up it was laying whose room is on the third floor two on the other side of Alice's.
audio-9742.300-9745.500|I liked her but I haven't talked to her much.
audio-9745.300-9757.300|I had the impression that she was shy she was one of the smallest adult side ever seen barely 5ft tall or 90 lbs with pale skin and wrist like saplings and wispy.
audio-9757.100-9761.200|Ash blond hair cropped close to her head high.
audio-9761.000-9765.800|She said now I just got home and I couldn't go upstairs without coming in here first.
audio-9765.600-9766.800|See what the noise was.
audio-9767.700-9772.700|I smiled with a sewing machine last thing you expected pretty close.
audio-9772.500-9775.200|I was torn between a dental drill in a blender.
audio-9775.000-9779.400|I introduced her to Kilroy and after they said hello she turned back to me.
audio-9779.200-9781.800|I've never actually seen anyone.
audio-9781.600-9786.600|So didn't you have to take sewing in high school homak she shook her head.
audio-9786.400-9802.700|I went to one of those Progressive schools where you didn't have to do anything including in 10 class says, I don't think they even offered homak tilray tilted his head and this was where In Connecticut Stuart Hall is the name of the school but it's not like that.
audio-9802.500-9806.900|I think the whole part is to placate the trustees a strange.
audio-9806.700-9808.500|Look him over Kilroys face.
audio-9808.300-9818.400|He said actually there was a big movement led by the trustees to drop the hall and rename the school Seward Country Center and the students about to keep it Seward Hall.
audio-9819.100-9820.300|Lindgren.
audio-9820.100-9826.900|Did you go there to he shook his head but didn't add anything and then glanced at me with a question on her face.
audio-9826.700-9830.200|Well, did someone you know, she asked?
audio-9830.900-9836.900|Someone I knew who she said when it's such a small place site.
audio-9836.700-9839.000|This would have been for your time.
audio-9838.800-9843.400|He went back to the newspaper and she bit her lip and gave me another serious.
audio-9843.200-9847.100|Look I Shrugged I couldn't explain it.
audio-9846.900-9848.500|This was just Kilroy.
audio-9848.300-9849.600|Mr.
audio-9849.400-9850.000|Mysterious.
audio-9849.800-9850.700|Mr.
audio-9850.500-9854.400|I don't need anyting Lane headed for the staircase.
audio-9854.200-9855.900|Good night.
audio-9855.700-9857.300|She called over her shoulder.
audio-9858.100-9865.500|In the kitchen I said the ironing board near an outlet then brought the iron out plugged it in and poured a little water into the reservoir.
audio-9866.400-9869.800|You know till reason I think I'll head home.
audio-9870.600-9871.700|I was stunned.
audio-9871.500-9875.000|I was 15 minutes from finishing 20 at the most.
audio-9874.800-9882.000|I'm almost done I said, yeah, but I'm really be I'm going to take off.
audio-9882.800-9892.000|Jackie was draped over a chair and he crossed the room and pulled it on gave me a smile and a wave said see you and move past me to the doorway.
audio-9891.800-9900.900|I turned and watched as he made his way down the dimly-lit hallway less and less distinct in the growing Darkness until they open the front door and disappeared.
audio-9900.700-9907.500|My heart was pounding our first fight I thought but it didn't cute.
audio-9907.300-9914.500|It seemed incomprehensible what it even happened to fight even angry but not at me.
audio-9914.300-9918.400|I was angry at him for leaving but more than that.
audio-9918.200-9919.200|I was mystified.
audio-9919.000-9923.800|Why hadn't he said the name of the person he'd known who went to Lane School.
audio-9923.600-9929.400|Why say you knew someone and then refuse to say whom and what about what happened with Greg?
audio-9932.600-9940.200|I woke the next morning feeling disoriented and letting guilt and doom returning to me instantly trying to fall asleep.
audio-9940.000-9943.700|I'd spiraled from Mike to Kilroy to Mike and right away.
audio-9943.500-9948.900|I was at it again and it was dim the Alcove the flat light of early morning.
audio-9948.700-9952.300|I reached for my watch and was surprised to find it was after 10.
audio-9952.100-9960.000|I got up and went to the soon-to-be covered stairwell window and wonder I'd slept in the sky was closed and gray.
audio-9960.700-9967.200|Tell her I didn't call until 5 as he was about to leave the advertising agency where he'd been working all week.
audio-9967.000-9973.300|He wondered if I wanted to meet him at mcclanahan's or maybe meet him at his house so he can get out of his work clothes.
audio-9973.100-9975.400|I met him at his house.
audio-9975.200-9988.600|I got there first and wait in the vestibule wondering what to say about last night what to think at last he pulled open the outside door and came in his hair was tucked behind his ears his face smoothly shaved.
audio-9988.400-9997.400|He always came home to change before he did anything else but I liked how he looked in his work clothes uncomfortably handsome today.
audio-9997.200-10001.600|He were khaki pants in a blue dress shirt that brought out the pedal Flex in his eyes.
audio-10002.400-10003.600|Sorry, you had to wait.
audio-10003.400-10006.200|He said he seemed a bit breathless.
audio-10006.000-10016.600|He let us into the lobby and went into the mailroom for a moment and came back out and press the button for the elevator to he said tiring day.
audio-10016.400-10018.600|I've just been hurrying.
audio-10018.400-10021.900|He talked his male under his arm and reach for my hand.
audio-10021.700-10032.100|He interlocks his fingers with mine, but then the elevator arrived and you like going we stepped on WE reached his floor and he held the elevator door as I stepped off.
audio-10032.900-10036.800|His apartment he dropped his mail in the kitchen and then went into the bedroom.
audio-10037.800-10042.300|Want to go get a beer he called I made my way down the hall.
audio-10042.100-10053.500|He was standing there in his blue shirt his khakis already tossed over a chair back the last 24 hours fun through my mind Kilroy talking to Simon and Greg in the kitchen.
audio-10053.300-10055.500|Then the thing was laying in her school.
audio-10055.300-10058.400|I didn't actually want to go get a beer.
audio-10058.200-10060.000|I approached him.
audio-10059.800-10065.600|And as I walked I pulled my sweater over my head and tossed it onto the bed when I reached him.
audio-10065.400-10077.100|I slip my fingers into the leg of his jockeys and touched his Supple balls rolling them for a moment between my fingers until I was ready to wrap my fingers around his hardening erection.
audio-10078.000-10079.200|It surprised me.
audio-10079.000-10082.800|He said in a soft choked Voice still.
audio-10083.600-10085.700|Yes, he said.
audio-10088.800-10093.700|I enter the phase of intense listening and hope that I can learn more about him.
audio-10093.500-10099.100|I wanted facts I saw myself as The Perennial graduate student.
audio-10098.900-10105.700|He said I should be go to students of him a researcher in a Carol typing notes into a laptop.
audio-10106.700-10109.600|I left one Library only to build myself another.
audio-10110.500-10114.800|What did I learn he like to read he likes to drink beer.
audio-10114.600-10115.900|He like to shoot pool.
audio-10115.700-10125.100|He like to make love with me is this I wondered it's this he would have said if I'd asked its us.
audio-10126.200-10127.700|One Saturday afternoon.
audio-10127.500-10130.200|He lay on his couch reading while I sewed.
audio-10130.000-10135.400|I heard a thump and looked up to see that he closed his book and dropped it onto the floor.
audio-10136.100-10142.100|He shut his eyes and stretched his arms reaching over his head and his stocking feet arching.
audio-10142.800-10146.700|relaxing he looked at me and said do you hear it?
audio-10147.500-10156.300|Hear what the call of a bookstore don't you hear that little voice calling Kilroy Kilroy?
audio-10157.200-10158.500|You finished that one?
audio-10159.300-10168.700|He swept his hair from his foreign really we should go to the Strand so I can make some space but I don't think I'll have what I want what you mean make some space.
audio-10168.500-10177.600|He gestured at his bookcase tall narrow and so crammed with books that I didn't see how it could hold another volume time to send it out.
audio-10177.400-10182.200|They buy used books at the Strand why not just get another bookcase.
audio-10182.000-10193.600|This was something I thought before you certainly have the wall space for 1 He shook his head that's strictly forbidden by whom myself, of course.
audio-10194.900-10196.900|We had a downtown toward Soho.
audio-10196.700-10203.700|There was a bookstore on MacDougal Street that he thought would have what he wanted a translation of a biography of Galileo.
audio-10204.900-10218.800|In the book store, we separated and I wandered back to a display big expensive books fashion photography ipage there one after another studying how one designer got from point A to point B, another sense of color evolved.
audio-10218.600-10226.600|If only I had more money I'd try making something complicated maybe a suit money money money.
audio-10226.400-10241.500|I was running through my savings $10 here $20 there 30 I'd ask my mother to find a month-by-month subletter for my apartment and she got in a lawsuit and who is paying me $100 a month be on my rent, but that was fluff in New York subway fare.
audio-10241.300-10248.800|My credit card virtually glowed in my wallet, but I didn't want to start down that path selling my car was the obvious move.
audio-10248.600-10268.000|I never drove it except to Move It from one parking place to another I was constantly racing out of the Brownstone in order to obey the system of rules controlling when you could park where Still it was my car the one place in New York where I can go to feel like myself even just for the 10 or 15 minutes it took to move it every few days.
audio-10268.900-10279.800|I found Kilroy in the Travel section an open book in his hands when he saw me flip to a big color photograph of a straight line by towering horse chestnut trees all a bloom.
audio-10280.700-10283.200|April in Paris the caption run.
audio-10283.000-10284.400|Let's go.
audio-10284.200-10292.500|He said did you find your Galileo book a slow smile lifted the corners of his mouth and he tapped the book to friend.
audio-10292.300-10295.400|He said let's go to friends.
audio-10295.200-10300.800|I started him his hair hanging over his foreign it sharp pointed nose.
audio-10300.600-10304.500|It was something serious and his expression something urgent.
audio-10304.300-10305.700|Okay.
audio-10305.500-10309.700|I said let's and he nodded briskly good.
audio-10309.500-10314.200|Let's settle isn't he bought the Galileo book and then we left the store.
audio-10316.400-10323.600|A few days later a small package arrived at The Brownstone with morning mail a little padded envelope inscribed with my name.
audio-10323.400-10344.000|The handwriting was faintly familiar, but I couldn't place it postmarked Madison inside all by itself with no note of explanation was an unmarked cassette tape and only once I knew it come from Mike that my name is been written by his mother who had been unable to bring herself to put her own name and address on the upper left-hand corner.
audio-10345.200-10350.500|The Brownstone was empty and no I was sure would be okay to use any of the stereos in the house.
audio-10350.300-10352.900|I didn't feel right not asking first.
audio-10353.700-10358.300|I took the tape out to my car which was parked under a bare tree two blocks to the South.
audio-10358.100-10369.700|The driver's seat was cold through my jeans the car started easily then sputtered and died the engine called again, and I gave it some gas then switch the heater on and split in the tape.
audio-10370.400-10376.000|The first thing was a deep sigh and I bit my lip wondering how I would be able to stand it.
audio-10377.100-10379.300|Hi Carrie, it's October 30th.
audio-10379.100-10383.500|I guess I should say that if I were writing you a letter, I'd write it.

audio-10406.700-10413.200|They got over there one Saturday guys the happiest I've ever seen him and she's really nice.

audio-10449.300-10451.200|I can't blank out parts of the tape.
audio-10452.300-10460.900|As I listened to him talk I reached on to the passenger seat for my purse and got out my wallet for there was an old picture of him his school picture from senior year of high school.
audio-10461.900-10463.900|Anyway, he said on the tape.

audio-10475.800-10479.200|It was a final click in the blank tape Waring in the machine.
audio-10479.000-10483.600|I reached over and press rewind and rest in my far at against the steering wheel.
audio-10483.400-10490.700|I felt bright and strange floodlit around the edges and dark at the very center.
audio-10493.000-10493.900|That afternoon.
audio-10493.700-10496.200|I met Kilroy mclanahan's after work.
audio-10496.000-10499.400|He like 6, there are only half-full.
audio-10499.200-10500.400|You were Guppies.
audio-10500.200-10504.800|He was sitting at the bar when I arrived wearing his leather jacket over a brown shirt.
audio-10504.600-10506.700|I finished beer in front of him.
audio-10506.500-10524.900|He looked up and gave me what I thought of as his amused Smile as if he were amused by me, but the fact of us what news has since I climbed on the stool next to his I Shrugged gave me a quizzical look then reach for a pack of matches and fiddled it between his fingers.
audio-10524.700-10532.600|No news is good news, then I guess be sure he waved the bartender.
audio-10532.400-10534.500|I got a tape today.
audio-10535.500-10539.700|A tape from Ice Age raises eyebrows.
audio-10539.500-10540.800|What did he say?

audio-10542.400-10547.700|Well for one thing roosters getting married to Joni intensive care nurse.
audio-10548.600-10550.600|I stopped talking and face Kilroy.
audio-10551.500-10555.200|Why is it I said that you don't want to tell me about any of your old girlfriends.
audio-10555.000-10558.000|When was the last time you were involved with someone?
audio-10558.700-10560.900|A weary look passed over his face.
audio-10560.700-10564.600|I don't have old girlfriends the way you have your old boyfriend.
audio-10564.400-10567.200|Okay, then how do you have them?
audio-10567.000-10571.300|I don't see latest four fingers side-by-side on the bar.
audio-10571.100-10573.300|You're barking up the wrong tree.
audio-10574.500-10579.300|In a small crowded voice I said which tree should i bark up?
audio-10579.100-10582.300|And when killer I looked away I couldn't help it.
audio-10582.100-10583.200|I had to press harder.
audio-10584.200-10593.300|Well Witchtree, why don't you try not barking he snapped he stared at me with a terrible sneer capsizing his mouth.
audio-10593.100-10594.500|And finally I got off.
audio-10594.300-10600.400|My soon's funkaway passed the bar between The Empty Tables through the heavy door and out into the night.
audio-10601.700-10604.300|Back at The Brownstone ice pops on the futon.
audio-10604.100-10609.200|I wanted to call him and didn't wanted him to call me and want them to vanish.
audio-10609.000-10615.100|I went out to The Landing for the phone and carried it back to the futon halfway through darling.
audio-10614.900-10616.300|I press the disconnect button.
audio-10616.100-10619.000|I sat there holding the phone on my lap.
audio-10618.800-10621.500|And then without really thinking about it.
audio-10621.300-10632.300|I dialed Jamie and Madison when she heard my voice there was a long silence and then she said, how are you in such a way that I couldn't possibly misinterpreted as a question.
audio-10632.100-10634.400|She laughs too short cold off.
audio-10635.100-10636.300|I'm sorry, Jamie.

audio-10988.100-10990.700|He's lobbies for turkey sandwiches at his place.
audio-10990.500-10993.800|I'd argue that Thanksgiving wasn't just about turkey.
audio-10993.600-11001.500|It was also about a big crowd of people and eventually he's given in later the pie in the oven in the vegetables cooked in a raid in a casserole.
audio-11001.300-11002.900|He went to take a shower.
audio-11002.700-11010.800|I pour myself some more coffee thinking how much I liked his Domesticity the fact that he'd woken me to start cooking.
audio-11011.600-11019.000|I loved watching him the kitchen how we never used to cook but but move Shirley from step to step as if he understood the ingredients.
audio-11018.800-11022.300|So well that he knew just how much of each would yield the right combination of flavors.
audio-11022.100-11034.700|I finished my coffee and then set about cleaning sliding appeals into the garbage washing the bowls and knives with used wiping down the counters with a sponge that have been sprinkled with vinegar one of his tricks.
audio-11034.500-11038.200|I heard a shower shut off and a moment later the phone rang.
audio-11038.000-11054.400|I stared at it somehow this was a first the question of whether or not to answer his phone it rang that rarely it rang a second time and across the room and picked it up thinking it could be Simon asking us to stop for something on the way over.
audio-11054.200-11062.500|Hello I said and there was a long silence before a woman's voice came over the line and said very tentatively hello back.
audio-11063.100-11068.100|Is this she said do I have she started again?
audio-11067.900-11069.800|Is Paul there?
audio-11070.600-11077.300|I nearly said she had the wrong number, but then realized Paul his real name just a minute.
audio-11077.100-11082.700|I said and I carried the cordless handset into his bedroom and knocked on the partly close bathroom door.
audio-11083.400-11089.300|He pulled it open with his foot naked phone I said and I handed it to him and walked away.
audio-11089.100-11094.300|I thought of closing the bedroom door on my way out, but I didn't and then it was too late.
audio-11094.100-11099.100|I heard hello and then a long silence in the kitchen.
audio-11098.900-11101.400|I turned on the water then quickly turned it off again.
audio-11101.200-11103.200|The woman's voice that sounded.
audio-11104.000-11112.400|There was no other word for it cultured older, although older than myself for older than kill ride and no.
audio-11113.200-11136.400|No, he said and then there was another silence because I don't he said and then as a matter of fact I do and then I turned on the water and let it run until something caught in my peripheral vision and I looked into the bedroom in time to see the handset land with a small bounce in the center of the bed trust in his usual jeans, but also oppressed white shirt.
audio-11136.200-11140.600|Tilray came into the kitchen a little later and clamp the handset's wall unit.
audio-11140.400-11141.800|Who was that?

audio-11194.200-11197.500|At The Brownstone, we deposited our food on the kitchen table.
audio-11197.300-11205.500|Kilroy got himself a glass of wine and join Lane and a few others in the living room while I stayed with Simon who is standing over a saucepan at the stove.

audio-11317.900-11320.400|How he got his nickname along with Lane and Maura.
audio-11320.200-11329.000|There was a pressure behind my rib cage a breathless feeling I inhale deeply and then let it out again in Madison.

audio-11379.000-11383.000|It's not unless it's just a way to avoid having to think of yourself as ordinary.

audio-11750.600-11770.700|She was silent and I imagine that she was thinking as I was of the Christmas tradition we shared for as long as I could remember breakfast by the fire while we opened our presents the afternoon working together in the kitchen and then shortly after dark the two of us in the dining room with a perfect rare roast beef resting on a silver platter.
audio-11771.600-11775.600|Mom I said again, I'm so sorry.

audio-12122.500-12125.600|Wondering what the new year would mean to me and my boyfriend.
audio-12126.300-12139.800|My classes were held at Parsons Midtown campus just a couple blocks from Time Square and it was A Rush of stimulation to leave the subway and enter the street with its chaos of honking cars and squealing buses.
audio-12139.600-12141.300|Its towering buildings.
audio-12141.100-12144.200|Its giant electronic signs.

audio-12173.000-12181.900|He had us get large hardbound books with unlined pages and he told us to record our ideas and them about color silhouette.
audio-12181.700-12182.600|Whatever.
audio-12183.500-12188.800|Freakishly warm Saturday in February pulled me and Kilroy out onto the street.
audio-12188.600-12197.800|And before I knew it he was staring us to the Museum of Modern Art where I'd never been I wasn't wild for Museum's but it was the exact kind of thing.
audio-12197.600-12203.600|Tierra was always encouraging us to do go to new places see with new eyes, so I was game.
audio-12204.300-12207.900|When was the last time you were at a museum Kilroys once we were inside?
audio-12207.700-12214.100|I looked up at the high ceiling considering a few summers ago with Jamie.
audio-12213.900-12216.000|We went to the Art Institute in Chicago.
audio-12215.800-12220.200|She just finished a course in impressionism, and she was just insufferable.
audio-12221.500-12230.700|I thought of the day with Jamie after the Art Institute, we got cups of ice cream from a sidewalk vendor and sat on the steps side-by-side spooning it up.
audio-12230.500-12234.500|Jamie was coming off a bad crush em all we were sitting there.
audio-12234.300-12237.000|I happened to look over and see tears on her cheeks.
audio-12237.600-12244.100|I sent my ice cream down about to put an arm around your shoulder to comfort her, but she shook her head hard.
audio-12244.800-12245.900|I'm happy.
audio-12245.700-12248.200|She said I'm crying because I'm happy.
audio-12249.400-12252.300|Kilroy was watching these eyes searching mine.
audio-12253.000-12257.900|Call her he said I shook my head calling wasn't the same.
audio-12257.700-12261.600|I called Mike right after New Year's and it found his voice.
audio-12261.400-12266.500|So low, it had seemed he wasn't articulating his words so much is merely releasing them.
audio-12267.500-12269.300|And not going back at Christmas.
audio-12269.100-12274.200|I done something to Madison and everyone in it set it on an ice floe and giving it a push.
audio-12274.000-12277.900|What was I going to do now make a big deal about waving.
audio-12277.700-12278.100|Goodbye.
audio-12279.200-12283.400|We wrote up the escalator in Kilroy moved into the center of a room to wait for me.
audio-12284.100-12285.100|Okay.
audio-12284.900-12287.500|He said you know who this is, right?
audio-12288.400-12290.700|Picasso, there you go.
audio-12290.500-12293.800|This is my favorite painting in the whole world.
audio-12293.600-12297.700|If I could paint like this I can go to my earn completely happy.
audio-12298.600-12300.400|I looked at him surprised.
audio-12300.200-12303.400|Do you paint he shook his head?
audio-12303.200-12305.100|I hesitated.
audio-12306.000-12308.200|Did you he grimaced?
audio-12308.000-12310.000|No carry?
audio-12309.800-12310.900|I didn't paint.
audio-12310.700-12313.100|I didn't write I didn't compose music.
audio-12312.900-12317.300|I didn't play the piano or take acting classes or do photography.
audio-12318.000-12322.400|so much she didn't do I said it hasn't been easy.
audio-12323.400-12326.900|What you mean I said about going to your earn.
audio-12327.800-12330.800|It was a figure of speech when I die.
audio-12330.600-12332.600|I want to be cremated, don't you?
audio-12333.400-12335.000|I haven't really given it much thought.
audio-12334.800-12338.100|Do you also know where you want your ashes scattered?
audio-12337.900-12342.700|He thought for a moment maybe on a hillside in France.
audio-12342.500-12343.800|He nodded.
audio-12343.600-12356.400|Yeah on this Hillside in the bar about half an hour Inland from cun the place where I figured out the meaning of life, which is that is meaningless.
audio-12356.200-12361.300|Of course that you can spend your life doing anything you want and in the end it won't matter at all.
audio-12362.100-12364.500|His tone was light but he was flushed.
audio-12364.300-12365.100|Suddenly.
audio-12364.900-12369.400|He stared at me with his eyes bright and it was something in him.
audio-12369.200-12373.600|I've never seen before He barked at a strange laugh.
audio-12374.300-12375.100|What?
audio-12376.000-12386.300|Nothing, you just reminded me of someone else or of myself would someone else my heart pounded now that this moment was upon us.
audio-12386.100-12388.100|I was intensely nervous.
audio-12388.900-12391.500|Who I asked tremulously.
audio-12391.300-12397.600|I was sure his answer would open up an encyclopedia of jealousies because of course he meant a woman.
audio-12398.200-12402.400|But no one he said forget it.
audio-12402.200-12414.300|It doesn't matter and I saw it and turned away not angry so much as embarrassed and said there was a buzz at The Brownstone the following week.
audio-12414.100-12423.100|Alice was moving out giving up her room to go live with her boyfriend and his two room apartment near Tompkin square at Simon pointed out.
audio-12422.900-12438.900|She was going to be paying more rent have less space that was love for you and look for me because I could have a room for high ceilings 12 by 14 room with two windows in a closet end at $125 per month.
audio-12438.700-12442.800|It would mean adding just $25 to the $100.
audio-12442.600-12444.800|I got each month for my medicine subletter.
audio-12444.600-12449.200|It was so real so thrilling so easy.
audio-12449.900-12450.900|What do you think?
audio-12450.700-12453.600|I said to kilrea should I take it?
audio-12454.400-12455.800|We were in his living room.
audio-12455.600-12459.400|He lying on the couch reading I perched on its Edge.
audio-12460.200-12464.100|He closed the book around his finger and rested it against his stomach.
audio-12463.900-12466.400|Why does it matter what I think?
audio-12467.400-12474.100|My heartbeat stumbled and I looked across the room to where the uncovered window reflected us back at ourselves.
audio-12473.900-12480.700|It doesn't I said, I mean it does but it shouldn't for a while there.
audio-12480.500-12484.000|I was worried that you didn't even think I should be taking my classes at Parsons.
audio-12484.800-12488.300|He sighed and looked away then crossed his arms over his chest.
audio-12488.100-12492.300|His book still held tight officer Kilroy.
audio-12492.100-12494.400|He said is that what I am?
audio-12495.300-12496.400|I was taken aback.
audio-12497.600-12498.300|No.
audio-12499.100-12499.900|Good.
audio-12499.700-12503.500|He said I don't want to be anyone's cop least of all yours.
audio-12504.300-12510.700|white least of all mine because that way Madness lies, excuse me.
audio-12511.400-12512.400|It's just an expression.
audio-12512.200-12517.100|He said a quote that people so ignoramus lycee.
audio-12517.900-12520.000|He open the book and glanced at it.
audio-12519.800-12521.800|Then closed it around his finger again.
audio-12522.600-12524.800|I'm confused I said.
audio-12525.500-12526.700|He shook his head.
audio-12526.500-12528.100|Nevermind.
audio-12527.900-12528.800|Let's drop it.
audio-12528.600-12530.500|Take the room by all means.
audio-12530.300-12531.300|I think it's a good idea.
audio-12531.100-12533.700|I don't want to drop it.
audio-12533.500-12537.000|He looked away what's going on?
audio-12536.800-12539.100|I said you're so aloof.
audio-12538.900-12542.400|Sometimes you're like this mess of Untouchables honest.
audio-12542.200-12545.800|He looks back and raised his eyebrows briefly.
audio-12545.600-12549.300|Why do I know next to nothing about your past?
audio-12549.100-12549.700|I cry.
audio-12549.500-12552.100|Who did I remind you of the museum?
audio-12552.800-12553.900|You seem upset.
audio-12553.700-12556.500|He said blandly, fuck you.
audio-12556.300-12559.900|I lost myself in the couch and stormed into the kitchen.
audio-12559.700-12562.300|He came in after me and then stopped abruptly.
audio-12562.100-12565.000|His hands jammed in the front pocket of his Jean.
audio-12564.800-12566.700|I'm sorry.
audio-12566.500-12569.200|He said I know this is hard for you.
audio-12569.000-12570.200|I'm not all that forthcoming.
audio-12570.000-12572.900|You're not all that forthcoming.
audio-12572.700-12574.900|He didn't smile.
audio-12574.700-12577.100|What's the deal with your parents?
audio-12576.900-12580.800|I said with you and then he shook his head.
audio-12580.600-12583.000|We really I'm not being evasive.
audio-12582.800-12586.300|It's just I wouldn't even know how to begin to tell you.
audio-12587.100-12588.100|Just do it.
audio-12587.900-12591.300|He exhaled hard blowing up words.
audio-12591.100-12598.200|So his hair lifted from his forehead for a moment one person's just do it is another person's Mount Everest.
audio-12598.000-12603.400|Okay, he frowned look he wanted to know what I thought about your taking the room.
audio-12603.200-12608.000|I guess that made me uncomfortable because it sort of raise the question of why you weren't living here.
audio-12607.800-12612.700|I thought my face color and I looked away it's okay.
audio-12612.500-12616.400|I said, I understand it's too soon.
audio-12616.200-12618.100|He grinned.
audio-12617.900-12621.900|My internal body clock is set on glacial time.
audio-12621.700-12646.500|I knew what he meant that he moved with the slowness of glaciers the incremental progress of ice engine through time and space but what I thought of was the chill of it the chill inside him On Friday Kilroy surprise me with the rental car and we drove out to Montauk for the weekend when we returned on Sunday afternoon.
audio-12646.300-12652.500|Kilroy unlocked his door and they're lying on the hall floor was a thick cream colored envelope.
audio-12652.300-12654.100|What's that?
audio-12653.900-12656.700|I said he groans softly.
audio-12656.500-12666.200|Then Benton picked it up on the back flap a flourish of initials eluded me, but on the front, it was easy to read the single word written there Paul.
audio-12667.200-12669.800|He said under his breath.
audio-12669.600-12674.100|He shoved the envelope into his coat pocket and held the door open for me.
audio-12673.900-12675.700|Excuse me.
audio-12675.500-12681.300|He said and he vanished into the bathroom latching the door behind him pull.
audio-12681.100-12683.500|It had to be from his parents.
audio-12684.700-12690.000|I stared out the window at the Greenlight people in twos and threes walking down the Avenue.
audio-12690.800-12696.900|The toilet flush in Kilroy came out and stopped on the far side of the room still wearing his coat.
audio-12696.700-12698.300|Listen.
audio-12698.100-12701.800|He said I've got to do an errand.
audio-12701.600-12706.800|Do you want to go back to the Brownstone what errand I said where you going?
audio-12706.600-12708.900|He shook his head.
audio-12708.700-12716.000|I've got to run up town for something he put his hands on his hips and looked at issues to see my parents.
audio-12715.800-12716.600|Actually.
audio-12716.400-12718.600|Can I go with you?
audio-12718.400-12720.500|You don't want to do that?
audio-12720.300-12726.000|Believe me, but I do my Palms were damp and I wiped them on my jeans.
audio-12725.800-12727.400|I love you.
audio-12727.200-12729.400|I said, I want to meet your parents.
audio-12729.200-12734.500|Even if I've been about to say even if you don't want me to but I stopped myself.
audio-12735.600-12738.800|Even if you hate them, I don't hate them.
audio-12738.600-12741.300|He said it's just complicated.
audio-12741.100-12743.200|He licked his lips.
audio-12743.000-12745.600|I'm glad you said that though.
audio-12746.400-12748.200|He meant I love you.
audio-12748.000-12750.300|I said it in the dark in bed.
audio-12750.100-12763.600|But this was the first time I said it when you can see my face, you know what he said come I actually think he stopped and shook his head ruefully, then skirted the bed and came to stand in front of me.
audio-12763.400-12768.900|He held out his hand and said, please I'd like you to meet my parents.
audio-12770.500-12802.200|They lived on 77th between Park and Madison in an enormous house that was as wide as to Brownstones put together but made of a paler Stone and fronted by to curving flights of steps the joined in front of a gleaming dark wood door a main lettuce in I followed Kilroy through a living room full of antiques and lavish Persian rugs into what I thought must be the library a smaller Cozier room with dark green Walls and several pieces of leather furniture.
audio-12802.000-12807.600|There was a fire burning in the fireplace at Rave decanters on the table.
audio-12808.200-12821.400|Drink Kilroy said he grow Niger on the subway ride uptown and now his voice was tight and uneven sure he put ice in heavy crystal glasses and poured from one of the decanters.
audio-12821.200-12823.300|I tasted mine.
audio-12823.100-12826.700|Not sure I like the strong smooth smoking us of it.
audio-12827.500-12832.200|We sat side-by-side on a deep couch Pleasant loan place.
audio-12832.000-12833.500|He said Riley.
audio-12834.300-12846.600|A small compact man of about 70 appeared in the doorway gray-haired and wearing a muted plaid sport coat and looking so much like Kilroy that I saw instantly how Kilroy wood age.
audio-12847.400-12850.900|At my side Kilroy stood up Dad.
audio-12851.700-12854.600|The man came forward and offered Kilroy his hand.
audio-12854.400-12873.700|He was followed by an Exquisite woman of about 65 slender elegant dressed in what I knew was a weekend outfit of brown and cream checked trousers and a brown cashmere sweater said her face was made up Lightly for day for a day at home when your estranged son might stop by.
audio-12873.500-12880.400|She hadn't had a facelift and the softness at her chin and under her eyes contributed to her beauty.
audio-12880.200-12883.300|She was one of those women who would always be beautiful.
audio-12884.700-12892.100|Kilroys stepped around the coffee table and kissed her pale pink cheek Morton Fraser Barber Fraser.
audio-12891.900-12893.300|This is Carrie Bell.
audio-12893.100-12908.700|I stood up and Mr. Fraser and I shook then mrs. Fraser offered me her slim Cool Hand how lovely to meet you she said smiling and tipping her head to the side so that her soft gray gold hair brushed her shoulder.
audio-12908.500-12915.400|It's not often that we get to meet any of Paul's she hesitated friends.
audio-12916.000-12919.800|So Mr. Fraser said glad you can stop by.
audio-12919.600-12924.300|He glanced at his wife and she shook her head almost imperceptibly.
audio-12924.100-12930.500|We all stood there without quite looking at each other until a man in a dark suit came in and pour drinks.
audio-12930.300-12935.100|Mrs. Fraser's mouth tightening a little when she saw we already had ours.
audio-12934.900-12938.000|I wished I weren't wearing jeans.
audio-12938.700-12940.600|How have you been killed?
audio-12940.400-12941.700|His father said to him.
audio-12941.500-12945.400|It's been sometime Kilroy nodded.
audio-12945.200-12950.400|Okay, one corner of his mouth Rose into a cockeyed half-smile.
audio-12950.200-12954.400|Same old same old then he glanced at me and added quietly.
audio-12954.200-12960.100|Well almost mrs. Fraser lean forward her hands clasped together.
audio-12959.900-12962.400|Tell us what you do.
audio-12962.200-12965.700|She said to me do you work or are you a student?
audio-12965.500-12967.800|I'm a part-time student.
audio-12967.600-12971.200|I said I'm taking courses at Parsons.
audio-12971.000-12973.100|Is that right?
audio-12972.900-12977.400|She said and what are you studying fashion design?
audio-12977.900-12979.000|Right up your alley.
audio-12978.800-12979.400|Mom.
audio-12979.200-12981.300|Kilroy said not unkindly.
audio-12982.100-12989.100|There was a long silence Kilroy and I were together on the couch his parents in separate leather chairs opposite us.
audio-12989.800-12997.900|Mrs. Fraser lifted her glass to her mouth barely opening her lips enough to admit any of the drink Jane called yesterday.
audio-12997.700-13003.700|She said she hesitated and I wonder who Jane was what was going on.
audio-13003.500-13011.800|There was something in the atmosphere that the three of them were aware of and I couldn't tell if it was just their discomfort with each other or something more.
audio-13012.600-13014.400|How was she killed her?
audio-13014.200-13018.100|I said they're just back from diving off the Caymans.
audio-13017.900-13025.700|Mac came face-to-face with a shark how ironic Kilroy said and his parents each suppress a smile.
audio-13025.500-13027.600|She asked about you.
audio-13027.400-13039.700|Mr. Frazier said I'm sure she did Kill return to me my older sister explained and a look of faint surprise pass between his parents at his having to tell me.
audio-13040.500-13043.600|I barely touched my drink but Kilroys was nearly empty.
audio-13043.400-13047.900|He put it on the coffee table carefully centering it on a coaster.
audio-13047.700-13056.400|He stood up and said to me we better go for going to make that reservation his mother looked up at him reservation.
audio-13056.200-13060.900|She glanced at me a quick look that took in my jeans my straggly hair.
audio-13060.700-13066.100|Where are you going a place downtown pool things.
audio-13065.900-13068.100|We never go below 50th Street.
audio-13067.900-13072.300|She said to me, but in fact one of our favorite places in SoHo.
audio-13072.100-13074.900|Do you know Clos de la Violette?
audio-13074.700-13076.900|I shook my head.
audio-13076.700-13078.300|It's lovely.
audio-13078.100-13084.100|She said we were also for a moment until abruptly Kilroys father stood too.
audio-13083.900-13089.100|Well, he said I'm glad you could come by very nice.
audio-13090.200-13099.100|Out in the hall a clock chime seven times and after a moment, Mr. Fraser should Kilroy his hand again, and he and mrs. Fraser walked us to the door.
audio-13099.800-13102.200|Mrs. Fraser was waiting to say goodbye.
audio-13102.000-13108.900|She shook my hand and put her Palm on Kilroys arm or thinner fingers against his Tweety coat.
audio-13108.700-13110.600|Don't be such a stranger.
audio-13110.400-13116.500|She said lately and he flushed and look down then reach the shiny brass door knob.
audio-13119.600-13125.500|Tell me was edgy and remote that evening not wanting to talk about the visit not wanting to talk.
audio-13125.300-13127.000|In the morning.
audio-13126.800-13134.500|I woke to the sound of the front door clicking shut 8:33 according to the red numerals of Tori's bedside clock.
audio-13134.300-13136.400|He was on his way to work.
audio-13137.400-13144.400|I borrowed back towards sleep, but something pulled me back the fact that he never before left without saying goodbye.
audio-13145.600-13148.900|No note in the kitchen no coffee in the coffee maker.
audio-13148.700-13151.700|Well, he probably overslept.
audio-13151.500-13156.800|I wandered out to the living room and pushed his coat away so I can sit on the couch.
audio-13156.600-13162.300|I pulled the code clothes and felt in the pocket half hoping he to remove the note.
audio-13162.100-13168.300|But there it was the date on it was March 20th Saturday it read darling.
audio-13168.100-13173.100|You must be thinking of the date as much as we are won't you come by and have a drink with us?
audio-13172.900-13177.400|It would mean so much to your father will be home today and tomorrow.
audio-13178.700-13185.300|I wondered what you must be thinking of the date as much as we are meant and why rather than male denote.
audio-13185.100-13192.500|She's come all the way down to Chelsea so she could enter the building and slide it under his door so he couldn't miss it.
audio-13192.300-13193.100|That was why.
audio-13193.900-13194.900|That evening.
audio-13194.700-13203.700|I tried calling Kilroy from The Brownstone after pattern-making at 6 when he was usually home and then it's 7 and then with mounting anxiety at 8.
audio-13203.500-13208.600|No answer and I couldn't leave a message because he didn't have an answering machine.
audio-13208.400-13211.700|Of course was he there letting it ring?
audio-13212.300-13221.900|I walked over to mcclanahan's the night dark and went a light rain Mist in my hair, but Kilroy was nowhere in sight by 9:30.
audio-13221.700-13224.600|I was in bed lying wide awake in the dark again.
audio-13226.200-13228.400|Standing at his door the next afternoon.
audio-13228.200-13248.800|I rapped once for good measure then slid my key into the lock it was before 5, but I wanted to be there when he got home from work inside a smell of burnt toast hit me and I was about to go into the kitchen when Kilroy appeared from the living room looking bedraggled and sweatpants and a ragged white T-shirt.
audio-13249.400-13253.800|Oh, it's you he didn't have to say his expression said it for him.
audio-13254.500-13255.600|I'm sorry.
audio-13255.400-13259.700|I said I didn't expect I stopped and shook my head.
audio-13259.500-13261.600|Did you skip work today?
audio-13262.400-13266.400|He lowered his head and moved it up and down without taking his eyes off the floor.
audio-13267.100-13271.600|I'm sorry I said again I thought I'd wait here for you to get home.
audio-13271.400-13273.600|I was worried about you last night.
audio-13273.400-13274.900|Are you okay?
audio-13276.000-13280.700|He let out of worship breath then looked up at me and smiled unconvincingly.
audio-13280.500-13283.700|Sure I can tell.
audio-13284.400-13288.600|Discount a little then turned and made his way back to the living room.
audio-13289.400-13295.500|Come on in he said grudgingly and then he flopped onto the futon what's going on?
audio-13295.300-13298.700|I said he didn't answer and I side.
audio-13298.500-13306.400|Do you want me to leave I said whatever I turned away and move down the hall into the bedroom.
audio-13306.200-13309.500|The blinds were drawn and the bed was a mess.
audio-13309.300-13312.500|I skirted the foot of it to sit on my side.
audio-13312.300-13317.900|I heard his footsteps and turn to see him standing in the doorway want to get some dinner.
audio-13317.700-13320.200|He said I could eat Chinese.
audio-13321.200-13323.600|I buried my face in my hands.
audio-13323.400-13336.000|I didn't know whether to laugh or cry I could eat Chinese as if this were a normal night in the course of our relationship what he said coming around stand before me.
audio-13335.800-13338.400|I looked up at him and shook my head.
audio-13338.200-13340.800|How can you act like nothing's happened.
audio-13340.600-13347.300|You are upset Sunday night after we left your parents and you still are and I just feel completely shut out.
audio-13347.100-13349.000|I'm sorry.
audio-13348.800-13351.900|He said dolly, then he turned to face me.
audio-13351.700-13354.900|Alright, he added his voice tightening.
audio-13354.700-13356.000|I'm sorry.
audio-13355.800-13357.200|I subjected you to it.
audio-13357.000-13359.000|It was fine.
audio-13358.800-13361.300|I said they were perfectly nice.
audio-13361.100-13366.100|That's not at all what I mean and you know it I called you a million times last night.
audio-13365.900-13367.000|What's wrong?
audio-13367.600-13369.600|He excelled hard and looked away.
audio-13369.400-13372.300|It's just difficult for me to see them.
audio-13372.100-13375.100|He said I have problems with them.
audio-13374.900-13380.600|He cleared his throat, you know, how you just got in your car and drove that night in September.
audio-13380.400-13389.000|He just locked up your apartment and took out your garbage and drove will sometimes it's just not possible to do that or it's not going to solve anything.
audio-13388.800-13396.000|I don't see my parents much and because of that it's hard when I do and to turn it around because it's hard when I see them.
audio-13395.800-13397.200|I don't see them much.
audio-13397.000-13399.000|I'm sorry about last night.
audio-13398.800-13405.100|I should have answer the phone I should have but I didn't and that's where we are now and I don't really know what else to say about it.
audio-13404.900-13414.300|Either we go on or we don't I can't be someone else much as you want me to be much as I want to be the weather like to do is clean up and then go get something to eat.
audio-13414.100-13416.400|He gave me a pleading look.
audio-13416.200-13418.000|Okay, please.
audio-13418.800-13428.300|I nodded I was less hungry than tired exhausted to the Bone but I understood that he couldn't say anymore and that we had to leave the apartment for a while.
audio-13428.100-13437.700|I made the bed while he's shower and then heading for the front door, we walk down the hole together our sides jostling awkwardly.
audio-13441.000-13458.100|Spring arrives with a cold clear wind that whipped the sky blue and left behind it are that was softer and warmer than it had been in months Kilroy and I went for walks and I had an idea that we were walking toward ourselves who we were together and who we could be.
audio-13458.900-13473.400|It occurred to me that we learn each other and stages facts first minis later like explorers who stumble onto bodies of water without knowing it first, whether they've encountered fog-shrouded rivers or vast oceans.
audio-13473.200-13484.700|We press on until we know but as we go something is lost the new becomes old and then taken for granted and then forgot with Kilroy.
audio-13484.500-13490.600|I wanted both to speed my way along and also to hold on to each separate moment of Revelation.
audio-13492.600-13501.100|One day I was at the Brownstone fresh out of the shower and standing in my room getting dressed when Greg knocked on my door and told me I had a phone call.
audio-13502.100-13504.200|Jamie wasn't crying at first.
audio-13504.000-13509.400|She said my name clearly but then she started a deep terrible weeping.
audio-13509.200-13530.900|I said what what is it, but she cried on and I thought it must be that she been dumped by Bill the whole thing over before she never gotten a chance to tell me about it, but it had nothing to do with Bill her sister Lynn had been assaulted in the parking lot of a bar on the far west side beaten up by a man driving a Cutlass.
audio-13530.700-13536.300|She had a black eye Bruises by her mouth finger marks on her neck.
audio-13536.100-13546.400|The alley that was the name of the bar a CD place out by the restaurant where she worked and Jamie's mother Jamie's mother had flipped out.
audio-13546.200-13562.000|Jamie was hysterical, but that was the essence of it and I didn't know what to say because all I could think was that the alley was the place I've seen Lynn all tarted up standing out in front her hair teased her face so made up that she had to have been asking for something.
audio-13562.200-13565.900|Trouble excitement rescue something.
audio-13565.700-13573.900|I known it then I surely is I've been too self-absorbed to do more than note it and move on listening to Jamie cry.
audio-13573.700-13578.500|I remembered Lynn sitting next to me and my car is fine and Tipsy.
audio-13578.300-13583.800|Don't tell Jamie she's said and I hadn't I hadn't.
audio-13584.400-13587.700|Oh, Jamie, I said oh God.
audio-13587.500-13589.300|I need you.
audio-13589.100-13595.900|She said I know I haven't called you at all and we've been like distant, but she started crying again.
audio-13595.700-13597.100|I need you.
audio-13596.900-13599.000|Could you come could you come home?
audio-13598.800-13600.600|You mean now?

audio-13612.000-13619.600|I didn't want to miss her visit and beyond that I simply didn't have the money a plane ticket on such short notice would cost a fortune.
audio-13619.400-13621.400|It was a bad time.
audio-13621.200-13623.500|That's what I said to Jamie.
audio-13623.300-13626.700|It's a bad time for me right now, but I can talk.
audio-13626.500-13628.800|Can we just talk on the phone?
audio-13629.600-13633.100|There was a long silence when she finally spoke.
audio-13632.900-13639.400|I knew I'd preached whatever remained of our friendship very coldly with no trace of Tears.
audio-13639.200-13647.800|She said I should have known I don't know why I even asked someone who dumps her boyfriend right after he breaks his neck.
audio-13647.600-13652.500|Forget it of course you wouldn't come and then she hung up on me.
audio-13655.800-13657.000|From the plane.
audio-13656.800-13661.300|I can see the end of winter coming the snow at the edges of the fields.
audio-13661.100-13668.500|Look tired and grey and the farmlands South Madison was black with wet cut into squares by County Roads.
audio-13668.300-13670.700|I took a cab from the airport.
audio-13670.500-13679.800|It was the middle of a Thursday afternoon and after the morning spent flying in the previous night spent making arrangements to leave I felt dazed.
audio-13680.500-13683.200|My mother's house gays blankly at the street.
audio-13683.000-13686.000|I dropped my bag in the front hall and went into the kitchen.
audio-13685.800-13691.800|The chairs were pushed close to the table the salt and pepper centered perfectly.
audio-13692.500-13695.400|I went to the phone and dial Jamie at her parents house.
audio-13695.200-13700.200|I didn't have much hope that you'd speak to me and she didn't she hung up the moment.
audio-13700.000-13705.300|She heard my voice as she had six times now for yesterday and 2 today.
audio-13705.100-13707.300|I called Kilroy.
audio-13708.200-13710.000|I was just thinking of you.
audio-13709.800-13721.300|He said what a coincidence not really we both laughed and I thought of how he kissed me that morning on 7th Avenue kiss me and said, okay go now.
audio-13722.400-13725.100|So he said you were there.
audio-13724.900-13734.700|Yep, Jamie just hung up on me again before or after you could say you were back before keep me posted.
audio-13734.500-13748.200|I will I said When my mother came in her hand went to her throat in the split-second between seeing me and seeing it was me who Cheese's she said good Christ.
audio-13748.000-13749.000|You scared me.
audio-13748.800-13753.200|Sorry we hugged and I smelled the moisturizer.
audio-13753.000-13757.300|She'd been using since I was a child is this because of Janie?
audio-13758.100-13761.400|You know, she gave me a tired smile.
audio-13761.200-13765.600|I've been at the hospital since 6 it turned out.
audio-13765.400-13787.800|Jamie had called her the previous day even before she'd called me called for advice for help my mother and I sat in the kitchen and she told me all about it by Jay need phone to her from the hospital how my mother to cancel the rest of her appointment so she could go she said apparently when men came home night before last and mrs. Fletcher saw her she broke down.
audio-13787.600-13806.800|She started with Valium and drinking too much of both Linden call Jamie home until yesterday morning and by then mrs. Fletcher was unconscious when I got there mrs. Fletcher was in one room having her stomach pumped and Lynn was being examined in another room and Jamie was going back and forth between them.
audio-13807.400-13810.400|I stared at my mother talking to Jamie.
audio-13810.200-13813.500|I hadn't understood the gravity of mrs. Fletcher situation.
audio-13813.300-13816.700|Are you saying mrs. Fletcher tried to kill herself?
audio-13816.500-13823.100|My mother friend, whatever her intentions were Jamie saved her life the doctor.
audio-13822.900-13825.800|I talked you said another hour or two and it might have been too late.
audio-13826.700-13828.000|Oh my God.
audio-13827.800-13834.200|I said I was horrified I could hardly believe how cold I've been to Jamie on the phone.
audio-13834.000-13835.600|It's not a good time.
audio-13835.400-13840.800|Jamie had been right to hang up on me right to refuse to listen when I called back.
audio-13841.700-13846.000|How is mrs. Fletcher I asked her there watching her.
audio-13845.800-13846.900|I don't know.
audio-13846.700-13847.500|What's going to happen.
audio-13847.300-13849.400|What about Lynn?
audio-13849.200-13852.300|Do you know how she is my mother friend?
audio-13852.100-13855.600|It's a long road back from something like this.
audio-13855.400-13856.400|I guess she's okay.
audio-13856.200-13860.200|Physically, I nodded nearly unable to ask.
audio-13860.000-13862.900|My next question was she raped?
audio-13863.700-13864.900|Apparently not.
audio-13864.700-13867.400|I think you should hear about it from Jamie though.
audio-13867.200-13870.100|I blew it when she called me.
audio-13869.900-13876.100|I said she asked me to come home and I said I couldn't my mother turned around her face full of compassion.
audio-13875.900-13876.600|Now.
audio-13876.400-13881.900|She knew I've tried her million times since then she won't speak to me.
audio-13881.700-13883.000|What can I do?
audio-13882.800-13888.400|My mother said her water glass on the table and then came around to my side.
audio-13888.200-13890.500|She gave me a pat on the shoulder.
audio-13890.300-13897.500|I think you know The next morning I put on a pair of black pants.
audio-13897.300-13901.700|I'd made in the fall and a velvet shirt and I set off for the Fletchers.
audio-13901.500-13906.900|There were no cars out front only mrs. Fletcher station wagon at the end of the driveway.
audio-13906.700-13911.100|I tapped on the front door then went around the back and try the mudroom.
audio-13910.900-13917.400|No one responded, but the door wasn't locked and I pushed it open and quietly went in right away.
audio-13917.200-13929.200|I saw Jamie's winter coat on a hook and a side of it galvanized me sent me past the basement stairs and widens the kitchen which smelled ever-so-slightly of what was it cornbread?
audio-13929.800-13940.600|I crept up the back stairs then tiptoed to Jamie's old room the door was all but closed and I dreamed my fingers against it softly pushing it open at the same time.
audio-13940.400-13947.800|She was in bed asleep bunched in a fetal position knees bent arms held close to her body.
audio-13948.700-13949.900|From downstairs.
audio-13949.700-13962.500|I heard a noise and I made my way out of her room and down the front stairs to the dining room or I found her middle sister mixy sitting at the table with a cardboard cup of coffee in hand and a vaguely board look on her face.
audio-13962.300-13964.900|That didn't change a bit when she saw me.
audio-13965.600-13973.800|I Borg did I said she Shrugged she's always been pretty but was beautiful now in a salty self-conscious way.
audio-13973.600-13975.600|Did she talk to you?
audio-13975.400-13977.300|She's still asleep.
audio-13977.100-13985.200|I pulled out the chair opposite her and sat down she spent last summer in California, which meant I hadn't seen her in almost a year.
audio-13986.200-13987.300|How are you?
audio-13987.900-13994.300|How do you think she took a sip of her coffee and I wished I'd had one to something to hold.
audio-13995.100-14000.600|I said I was really a jerk the other day, but I'm here now getting she'll talk to me.
audio-14000.400-14003.400|She Shrugged I don't know.
audio-14003.200-14005.500|It's not just about the other day.
audio-14005.300-14007.100|What do you mean?
audio-14007.900-14011.400|Lynn told us about running into out at that bar last summer.
audio-14011.200-14013.500|She was sure you told Jamie.
audio-14013.300-14014.500|She was hurt.
audio-14014.300-14015.600|Jamie didn't seem to care.
audio-14015.400-14021.800|I heaved a big sigh she made me promise not to tell I said Langley.
audio-14022.500-14034.600|Jamie thinks you should have any way I turned and looked out the front window light blue Oldsmobile went past just like mrs. Mayer's was I going to call Mike while I was here?
audio-14034.400-14037.400|How could I how could I not?
audio-14038.400-14043.300|From upstairs that came to sudden insistent chirping Jamie's alarm clock.
audio-14043.100-14060.800|You should go mixi said That evening my mother took me out to dinner without my saying so she seemed to understand what had gone on with Jamie and we talked and said about New York and Parsons the world of possibility.
audio-14060.600-14069.300|I saw him now in the world of clothes afterwards, my mother pulled into her driveway, igniting a sensor flood light mounted to the garage.
audio-14069.100-14075.400|She waved in the direction of the next door neighbor's kitchen window and turn to me with her eyes wide.
audio-14075.200-14082.000|Do you even know she said what rooster and Joan live next door?
audio-14081.800-14086.100|They're renting the Nelson's house the Nelsons move to Arizona.
audio-14087.100-14092.300|I turned and looked at the Nelson's kitchen window, but whoever she'd waved at was gone.
audio-14093.000-14108.000|rooster rooster my rooster very same we went inside but I was antsy couldn't sit for pacing avoided the windows that face the Nelsons and then spent long moments in front of them.
audio-14107.800-14123.500|Out finally, I got my coat back on and went over feeling strange about everything being back in Madison and not having called Mike the prospect of seeing rooster the notion that he was married in their married.
audio-14124.200-14128.900|He opened the door and his look told me he hadn't seen me when he waved at my mother.
audio-14128.700-14130.300|He was astonished.
audio-14130.100-14135.600|I thought of the telegram I'd sent in December can't make it after all.
audio-14135.400-14142.500|Sorry stop congratulations stopped and I felt sick was remorse.
audio-14142.300-14146.000|He said this is weird in so many ways.
audio-14145.800-14147.300|I can't even count them.
audio-14147.100-14149.100|I don't have enough fingers.
audio-14148.900-14156.200|He took a step back and I followed him into the kitchen all bright and cheery white with a lot of red accents.
audio-14157.000-14158.100|So you're back.
audio-14157.900-14160.500|He said just for a few days.
audio-14160.300-14161.800|What's the occasion?
audio-14161.600-14171.500|I hesitated we know was it okay to tell him I said Jamie's family is having problems is Jamie.
audio-14171.300-14171.700|Okay.
audio-14171.500-14188.200|I haven't really talked to her OU just got back this minute yesterday afternoon, actually, okay, he'd rolled and he said Mike doesn't know I shook my head, but he was telling me not asking.
audio-14188.000-14189.700|How is he?
audio-14189.500-14193.800|I said holding steady steady.
audio-14194.500-14196.800|Good days and bad you can imagine.
audio-14196.600-14200.100|So where's Joan working?
audio-14199.900-14203.600|I cocked my head some oranges good, huh?
audio-14204.500-14213.100|Rooster gave me a big smile the kind of widegren you try to control the can't I can't speak for the whole institution, but I certainly like mine.
audio-14212.900-14214.800|I'm glad for you.
audio-14214.600-14217.200|I said, I really meant it.
audio-14217.000-14224.800|I wanted him to know that almost said I really mean it but why wouldn't I let's not talk about Mike.
audio-14224.600-14228.800|He said then okay, were you wanting to do that?
audio-14228.600-14231.500|Because I really don't want to Okay.
audio-14231.300-14236.800|I said agreed which items for 5 or 10 minutes and then I left.
audio-14240.200-14257.200|The next day I went to see Jamie at work, but you refuse to speak to me back at my mother's exhausted and sad I opened my bedroom closet and there was my old Kenmore sewing machine and machine my Bernina had replaced sewing on the Kenmore.
audio-14257.000-14259.100|That was how I learned.
audio-14259.700-14266.200|It outweighed the Bernina by a good 10 lb and I loved it to my desk and set it down with a heavy clunk.
audio-14266.000-14273.800|My mother was on the other side of the wall in her office doing paperwork and in a moment, she appeared a curious look on her face.
audio-14273.600-14277.100|She saw the machine and broke into a smile.
audio-14276.900-14278.600|Look at that old.
audio-14278.400-14281.100|Jalopy pretty pathetic, isn't it?
audio-14281.700-14300.100|She had some new khaki she's been meaning to get hemmed and a little later I pin them for her then somehow managed to get the sewing machine working finding an old needle in a basket in my closet along with some thread and an empty bobbin when I asked it turned out she had some other alteration she needed done.
audio-14299.900-14313.600|So I sewed for a couple hours more taking in the waist on a skirt mending the torn lining of a Blazer it got dark and I turned on my desk lamp and in the pool of light it through worked until there was nothing more for me to do.
audio-14315.000-14319.600|Monday I drove my mother to work so I could use her car then drove home again.
audio-14319.400-14321.200|Wondering what to use it for.
audio-14321.000-14326.600|I wandered around the house sitting for brief periods in the different rooms.
audio-14326.400-14329.600|I didn't want to go shopping go anywhere.
audio-14329.400-14342.100|I didn't want to stay where I was I needed to reach Jamie but how I went out and got into the car and I turn the engine on and then off and then on again before driving the familiar streets to Mike's house.
audio-14342.900-14348.100|There were no cars out front and I rang the doorbell nervously wondering what I do.
audio-14347.900-14350.800|If no one answered if I'd come back again or not.
audio-14351.600-14353.400|How much did I want to see him?
audio-14353.200-14356.400|How much catch myself in the act of doing the right thing?
audio-14356.200-14365.700|I waited what felt like a long time and then I heard a faint humming and a voice repeating the same two words over and over so I could make them out.
audio-14365.500-14366.700|Finally.
audio-14366.500-14368.800|I open the door and there he was.
audio-14369.800-14374.300|Sitting in his wheelchair his knees angular inside loose.
audio-14374.100-14377.400|Khakis his arms on the arms of the chair.
audio-14378.500-14386.800|His face was slightly pink and suddenly I understood that he'd been yelling come in come in because he couldn't open the front door himself.
audio-14386.600-14395.100|His face was thinner than before very pale and bristly at the upper lip with an unfamiliar mustache.
audio-14396.100-14402.600|At the sight of me his eyes widened and then narrowed and his lips pressed into a side long crimp.
audio-14402.400-14411.300|He opened his mouth to speak then closed it again a deep flush climbed from his neck to his forehead and it lasts.
audio-14411.100-14414.400|He said I guess this is what's called being speechless.
audio-14414.200-14420.000|I took a step inside and hesitated awkwardly then bent to kiss his cheek.
audio-14419.800-14422.900|Not quite missing the edge of the mustache.
audio-14422.700-14426.300|I could have called but I broke off.
audio-14427.200-14428.300|This is too weird.
audio-14428.100-14430.300|He stared at me.
audio-14430.100-14433.000|It's just that I've imagined this so many times.
audio-14432.800-14434.600|He shook his head.
audio-14434.400-14435.900|Nevermind.
audio-14435.700-14436.300|That was stupid.
audio-14436.100-14439.200|Look come in or something.
audio-14439.000-14441.300|What stops to stand here at the front door?
audio-14442.400-14445.500|He gave me a half smile or sitting either.
audio-14445.300-14448.900|He moves a lever that operated the wheelchair.
audio-14448.700-14461.700|It was motorized unlike the one he had in rehab at least the one I'd seen he rolled backward and I close the door and followed him through the living room for the furniture had been rearranged to open a pathway.
audio-14462.800-14468.700|In the kitchen, he stopped you caught me during my mid-morning low breakfast has been accomplished.
audio-14468.500-14478.500|My 11 happened T break is Yet to Come and I'm not on the computer at all today to move forward the last foot or two and came to rest at the table.
audio-14479.300-14483.400|I pulled out a chair opposite him and sat down the computer.
audio-14483.200-14488.200|I'm hooked up to the system at my dad's office the exciting world of insurance.
audio-14488.000-14495.600|We got a nice little racket going where I bang around on the computer here for 10 or 12 hours a week and they pay me $15 an hour.
audio-14495.400-14501.800|Also, I won't feel completely useless Mike what nothing.
audio-14501.600-14502.900|I'm sorry.
audio-14502.700-14514.200|You've already said that my face burned the refrigerator began to hum, and I was relieved by just that tiny alteration in the way the room felt forget it.
audio-14514.000-14520.500|He said that was uncalled for how are you what brings you to Madison the Athens of the Midwest?
audio-14521.300-14522.400|I took a deep breath.
audio-14523.500-14528.400|Jamie Lynn got hurt and I came home because of that hurt.
audio-14529.300-14530.300|I lick my lips.
audio-14531.800-14546.600|Assaulting is she okay as okay as can be expected God that's terrible his arm slid forward a little and I try not to look at them the bone Enos the paddle like flatness of his hands.
audio-14546.400-14550.300|When did this happen last week?
audio-14550.100-14554.400|Mrs. Fletcher is pretty shaken up according to my mother.
audio-14554.200-14557.300|She's been transferred to a psychiatric hospital though.
audio-14557.100-14558.200|I left that part out.
audio-14558.000-14561.200|So how long you here for my cast?
audio-14561.000-14564.800|I'm not really sure he licked his lips.
audio-14564.600-14566.400|I didn't know what to do or the look.
audio-14567.500-14571.100|Come on, he said after a moment, I'll show you my room.
audio-14570.900-14573.900|I follow him back to a living room.
audio-14574.600-14586.000|We came to the den, but it once been a small dark room with plaid wallpaper was now light and Airy and somehow seemed bigger the walls white and decorated with frame pictures.
audio-14585.800-14600.700|I recognized his old striped blanket stretched over a hospital bed his computer and a picture of me that had sat on his bedside table now on a big swing arms and he could see from the bed.
audio-14600.500-14604.500|I looked at my smiling face and then looked away.
audio-14605.400-14606.400|Great.
audio-14606.200-14610.200|I said pretty different from my old room, isn't it?

audio-14671.300-14675.400|I felt manipulated, but also heartbroken.
audio-14676.200-14677.900|I decided to go back to New York.

audio-14897.800-14903.900|Like I'm a fucking quadriplegic rooster reached over and gave Mike solder a pet.
audio-14903.700-14907.200|You're not a fucking quadriplegic.
audio-14907.000-14911.600|He said quietly Mike rolls his eyes and smiled a little.
audio-14911.400-14913.600|Yeah, there's that too.
audio-14915.900-14924.300|After we dropped him off rooster and I got back into his new car and he drove me to my mother's the two of us silent all the way out in front.
audio-14924.100-14925.500|He cut the engine.

audio-14967.100-14970.100|What I was confused.
audio-14969.900-14975.000|You mean he rooster said I mean he wanted to die.

audio-15025.000-15027.100|He shook his head.
audio-15026.900-15029.900|He seems to have gotten Beyond it.
audio-15029.700-15035.100|I mean who knows what he's thinking about alone in bed at night, but he stopped talking about it.
audio-15034.900-15037.500|And you know what that's almost enough for me.
audio-15037.300-15039.500|Isn't that awful?
audio-15039.300-15044.800|No, I think it's awful but I can't help he started the car.

audio-15083.100-15087.100|I canceled my flight I couldn't go back yet.
audio-15086.900-15096.400|After what rooster had told me Kilroy wasn't happy and his unhappiness made me unhappy and when I told my mother that I was going to stay a while longer.
audio-15096.200-15103.900|She searched my face hard as if for an explanation, do you really want to she said it last?

Mayor was glacial it was she who answered the door and she held on tight as if I might pry her way and try to force her into a hug.
audio-15146.300-15155.200|She looks older and out of here nearly a year into mice tragedy her hair badly permed extra lines on her face.
audio-15155.000-15162.100|She wore a decade-old nylon sweat suit in a bright jade green that cast a gray light on her skin.
audio-15162.600-15164.800|She didn't bother trying to be nice.
audio-15165.900-15170.700|I stayed for about an hour Mister mayor came into the kitchen tall and broad-shouldered.
audio-15170.500-15172.900|His bald spot gleaming.
audio-15172.700-15179.500|He looked at me that he circled the table to stand behind me putting a hand on each of my shoulders.
audio-15179.300-15182.200|Isn't she a sight for sore eyes.
audio-15182.000-15187.800|He said to Mike and then he ruffled my hair and bent down to put the side of his face against mine.
audio-15190.300-15192.800|Monday morning, I went to Fabrications.
audio-15192.600-15198.200|I half expected to be disappointed after the place in New York, but the shop still had it sold.

audio-15252.700-15263.400|Never mind what the color did to her face as I watched the two of them talked trying to come up with a plan for altering it I think you'd have to take the sleeves off.
audio-15263.200-15271.700|The saleswoman said at one point then you could take out the plates and now it through here and get rid of that puffiness the customer side.
audio-15271.500-15273.700|I don't suppose you do any alterations.
audio-15273.500-15277.800|She said sorry saleswoman said shaking her head.

audio-15305.700-15310.500|I felt a little silly but excited too because I knew just what to do.
audio-15311.400-15313.800|Using pins from the box I bought on the spot.
audio-15313.600-15316.100|I took in the bodice adjusted the sleeves.

audio-15319.400-15324.100|Look I said leading her back to the mirror is not better.
audio-15323.900-15327.600|If you can kind of ignore the pins and squint a little you'll get the idea.
audio-15327.400-15330.300|I can't do anything about the hips.
audio-15330.100-15332.900|But the rest I don't have to squint.
audio-15332.700-15334.400|She said it's great.

audio-15345.300-15348.700|Although there were a few bad moments when the bobbin thread.
audio-15348.500-15353.500|Tangled and oily I charge $60 and a woman and I were both happy.
audio-15354.600-15357.300|Heading back to her car after picking up the dress.

audio-15376.000-15379.000|It was thrilling and I shook my head.
audio-15378.800-15379.700|Regretfully.

audio-15409.800-15412.300|I didn't mention that I'd stop trying to see her.
audio-15413.400-15414.800|I didn't mention Mike.
audio-15417.500-15423.000|I visited him every day just for a little while a half hour 45 minutes.
audio-15422.800-15428.800|He like going for walks around the neighborhood on weekday afternoons when the sidewalks were empty.

audio-15449.200-15460.600|It was a punishment and just enduring it was a form of mortification as a mortifying the flesh to cleanse the soul except that I was mortifying sold to cleanse.

audio-15762.800-15764.200|I'm sorry.
audio-15765.200-15773.400|My heart started just say I said, I twisted the phone cord around my finger then split it off.

audio-15787.800-15791.900|I want to live in New York more than you want to be with me.
audio-15791.700-15793.900|Is that an ultimatum?
audio-15793.700-15795.500|Didn't you?

audio-15802.400-15803.800|I felt dizzy.
audio-15803.600-15811.000|I thought of his hands on my arms how they were just the right size for my arms his hands on my breasts.
audio-15810.800-15825.100|I put my own hands on my breasts and they felt soft and flabby it felt like nothing like pockets of Flesh how extraordinary I thought that someone could touch you and make you into something.
audio-15827.500-15833.300|I took my cat to lunch sandwiches one day Pizza another in the van.
audio-15833.100-15834.100|He was quiet.

audio-15855.900-15867.000|Yes, he does we split a cookie and then left the restaurant and headed toward the band the afternoon sun felt good on my face clean about it about the air.
audio-15867.800-15877.900|The sidewalk was empty and I glanced in and Shop Windows as we went by in one a linen slip dress hung from a rack and I paused at my side.
audio-15877.700-15884.000|Mike stop to it was a nice grade purple some tiny crochet work along with straps.
audio-15884.700-15886.100|That look good on you.
audio-15885.900-15891.800|He said I looked down at him and when our eyes met a worried look came over his face.
audio-15891.600-15893.700|Should I not have said that?
audio-15894.500-15895.500|No, it's fine.
audio-15895.300-15897.100|Are you sure?
audio-15897.900-15902.100|I nodded my press the lever on his wheelchair and we started off again.
audio-15901.900-15903.600|Here we go.
audio-15903.400-15906.800|He said Mike Mayer takes Monroe Street.
audio-15909.000-15912.600|Kilroy and I talked twice a day every two days.
audio-15912.400-15919.400|It didn't matter being together required being together and our conversations became grave and lugubrious.
audio-15920.500-15932.000|I love you with an idea that demanded physical proximity back in the fall telling him about my life and Madison had been like handing him object after Precious object hold for safekeeping.
audio-15931.800-15933.100|Now.
audio-15932.900-15937.600|I told him about seeing Mike and it was like taking those objects back one by one.
audio-15938.500-15941.700|I felt split in half when I was with Mike.
audio-15941.500-15944.400|I thought of Kilroy when I was on the phone with Kilroy.
audio-15944.200-15945.300|I thought of Mike.
audio-15946.100-15948.400|His hard time with late afternoon.
audio-15948.200-15957.000|He was tired by then and his neck hurt and he had to spend time in bed lying on his side to avoid pressure sores from being in the wheelchair for too long.
audio-15956.800-15975.600|He could transfer himself with a board incredibly slowly incrementally burden on his shoulders as he insta long, but on harder days he let his mother move him if I happen to be there I watched while she planted her legs and went to work silent with concentration her face full of strain.
audio-15976.300-15977.300|Late one afternoon.
audio-15977.100-15980.400|He and I sat in his room together right around the time.
audio-15980.200-15981.500|He usually lay down.
audio-15982.400-15988.000|Can I transfer you I said I've been meaning to ask if I hadn't decided on today.
audio-15987.800-15991.800|I think I know how it's not about thinking.
audio-15991.600-15993.400|He said believe me.
audio-15993.200-15998.300|What is I turned and there was mrs. Mayor looking in on us.
audio-15998.100-16002.200|She did that a lot poster hadn't asked if he needed anything.
audio-16002.000-16009.300|It was like the old days when she didn't meant excuses to make sure we weren't having sex transferring me.
audio-16009.100-16011.800|Mike said Carrie offered to do it.
audio-16011.600-16015.000|She can't possibly Miss is Mayor exclaimed.
audio-16014.800-16016.000|That's out of the question.
audio-16015.800-16019.300|She faced me with her mouth Preston with inline.
audio-16019.100-16024.600|It's quite complicated if you lose him for a second, she wouldn't lose me.
audio-16024.400-16030.300|He said rolling his eyes obviously should be careful people have to be trained.
audio-16030.100-16034.100|She said it's a question of training then trainer.
audio-16033.900-16038.300|He snapped or better yet Monday both just get out of here, and I'll do it myself.
audio-16039.400-16052.700|Oh my mrs. Meyers said oh sweetheart her eyes were wide and I thought you would cry I couldn't look at him but I felt them off to my side sitting in his chair rage mask in his useless body.
audio-16053.400-16060.000|Then it was over mrs. Mayor came into the room and said, all right, let's trainer carry.
audio-16059.800-16060.900|This is the best workout.
audio-16060.700-16061.500|You'll see.
audio-16062.400-16066.600|It was harder than it looked the burden of his body was enormous.
audio-16066.400-16071.700|I knew I had to swivel him around but I was terrified to move terrified.
audio-16071.500-16075.400|He'd knock me over my arms were shaking finally.
audio-16075.200-16080.900|I just did it swallows around until the bed was behind him a dance of deadweight.
audio-16080.700-16085.600|I lowered him and behind me mrs. Mayor side extravagantly.
audio-16085.400-16098.600|I stood there panting then let his upper body down our eyes meeting as his head touched the pillow at last I raised his legs and smoothes out the fabric of his pants, so he wouldn't be lying on any creases.
audio-16099.400-16101.700|Well, mrs. Meyers said from behind me.
audio-16101.500-16108.900|Well, she claps her hands together as if dust in the mall be sure there's plenty of support under his head.
audio-16109.600-16113.300|Mike and I looked at each other after charge moment.
audio-16113.100-16114.200|We both last.
audio-16114.000-16115.300|Thanks.
audio-16115.100-16117.600|He said you're quite welcome.
audio-16121.200-16122.400|Next afternoon.
audio-16122.200-16124.500|I learned that my cat quit his computer job.
audio-16124.300-16126.200|He was tired of pretending.
audio-16126.000-16127.900|It was more than just a way to feel useful.
audio-16127.700-16129.800|I'm not useful.
audio-16129.600-16136.900|He said and Gathering data about fucking life expectancy rates isn't going to change that or how I feel about it.
audio-16136.700-16139.500|We were in the van together on the way home.
audio-16139.300-16149.900|I looked over at him strapped into his wheelchair his eyes droop that the outside corners even is mustache true today roaming the unhappy Arc of his mouth.
audio-16150.900-16157.100|How'd your dad react I said he was disappointed while maybe not disappointed.
audio-16156.900-16158.800|He just wants you to be happy.
audio-16160.300-16162.400|I think he's settled for a little less than that.
audio-16163.100-16164.900|We rode along in silence.
audio-16165.600-16168.800|He said Mom on the other hand was all for it.
audio-16168.600-16174.400|Why should you spend your time on something you hate when you don't need the money deer should be perfectly content.
audio-16174.200-16176.100|Abby be like that Tom guy.
audio-16176.800-16182.500|Mike she wouldn't Thomas AC3 he met who never breathe without a ventilator.
audio-16183.200-16184.100|You know what?
audio-16183.900-16184.300|I mean?
audio-16185.000-16196.900|I knew mrs. Mayor wanted Mike to count on her no matter what she didn't always see how hard it was that he had to he's a head on a pillow like flirted and that were me I'd rather be dead.
audio-16196.700-16200.700|I brakes and turn to face him Mike.
audio-16200.500-16207.500|I would he looked at me defiantly and my first impulse was to look away brush it off.
audio-16207.300-16214.200|You didn't say that, but he had Will you I hesitated?
audio-16214.900-16216.400|Will you tell me more?
audio-16217.300-16218.200|Immediately.
audio-16218.000-16219.900|I felt my face filled with heat.
audio-16220.600-16226.800|Tell me Clarice phrase after while Mike side and began to speak.
audio-16226.600-16230.000|I read somewhere that after something like this.
audio-16229.800-16242.300|You spend your life either looking for a reason or looking for a cure, but you know what, there is no reason and there is no cure there just isn't I went to this church thing a few times and it was crazy.
audio-16242.100-16247.800|It was like all these people are just dying to have me decide that God had a plan for me.
audio-16247.600-16249.600|Why would that make a difference?
audio-16249.400-16252.900|I think I stopped really believing in God around the same time.
audio-16252.700-16255.400|I stopped believing in Santa Claus and it's breaking.
audio-16255.200-16257.800|My neck was supposed to help me start believing again.
audio-16257.600-16258.600|Why on Earth?
audio-16258.400-16260.300|Would that be a comforting idea?
audio-16261.000-16262.200|He shook his head.
audio-16262.000-16270.500|My therapist says maybe the hardest challenge is having to live with Suicidal Thoughts having to accept them as part of the whole damn package.
audio-16270.300-16272.000|He stared at me.
audio-16271.800-16273.800|Are you going to take me home or not?
audio-16274.800-16277.800|I took my foot off the brake and drove the rest of the way to the mayor's.
audio-16278.700-16281.800|Had the driveway he's at the bump and stops in front of the garage.
audio-16281.600-16283.300|I cut the engine.
audio-16283.100-16288.500|My heart was pounding I send do you have Suicidal Thoughts a lot?
audio-16289.300-16290.700|He looked at me and looked away.
audio-16290.500-16292.300|I did.
audio-16292.100-16294.300|I mean I still do but not as much.
audio-16295.200-16298.500|That must be a search for what to say.
audio-16299.300-16300.700|I must be hard.
audio-16301.400-16304.000|He sighed it's exhausting.
audio-16303.800-16308.800|It's like you have these pictures in your mind and your pulled for them at the same time.
audio-16308.600-16310.600|You're trying like hell to stay away from them.
audio-16311.400-16316.700|Mike I said Softly he looked away.
audio-16317.600-16325.800|After while he said I'm ready to go in now and I climb down from the van and went around to the other side then stood waiting level lift lowered him.
audio-16325.600-16331.700|I walked up the ramp behind him his wheelchair humming at the top we stopped.
audio-16332.400-16336.400|Want to sit out here for a while I said, would you like something to drink?
audio-16336.200-16337.700|No.
audio-16337.500-16338.000|Thanks.
audio-16339.100-16340.200|Neither of us spoke.
audio-16340.000-16342.300|I leaned against the railing.
audio-16342.100-16347.700|Mrs. Mara was in the kitchen her shape as she moved around just visible through the clean windows.
audio-16348.400-16357.000|Mike Mayer has a Moreau spell he said glancing at me and smiling a little he sits in his wheelchair and contemplates the back lawn.
audio-16360.300-16361.300|One afternoon.
audio-16361.100-16364.500|I stood hesitating as the top of the mayor's basement stairs.
audio-16364.300-16369.000|I could hear the dryer pounding smell detergent and heated cotton.
audio-16369.700-16374.800|Mike was in his room resting and I started down wishing there was something to knock on.
audio-16374.600-16377.300|This was mrs. Mayer's domain.
audio-16377.100-16384.100|She was standing at a long table a huge basket of laundry at her feet in front of her.
audio-16383.900-16390.800|Everything was in neat Stacks stock sorted shirts folded just so excuse me.
audio-16390.600-16393.800|I said she looked up and found a little.

audio-16396.400-16399.600|I continue down the stairs until I reach the concrete floor.

audio-16443.700-16445.400|Her mouth tightened.
audio-16445.200-16447.100|I want to do it.
audio-16446.900-16452.300|I said you can hate me for the rest of your life, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm here now.

audio-16496.000-16508.800|We sat in the kitchen waiting for the doorbell Mike's attendant was due to arrive at 9 to help him shower and go to the bathroom administer his VP as mrs. Mayor said his bowel program.
audio-16509.600-16511.500|I sat on the deck while they were busy.
audio-16511.300-16517.200|Finally Mike wheeled outside his hair still wet a sheepish smile on his lips.
audio-16518.100-16520.900|Remember when BP stood for beautiful people.
audio-16520.700-16523.800|He said the times they have changed.

audio-16995.200-17007.700|I said I thought I was going to I would have and he said I figured you wanted then neither of us spoke for hours weeks.
audio-17008.400-17014.200|I held the phone Loosely but my palm crew slick anyway, and I had to pass the receiver from hand to hand.
audio-17015.200-17016.200|I feel terrible.

audio-17045.100-17048.700|I knew this was a front that he was terribly hurt.
audio-17048.500-17050.800|But to say so would hurt him more.
audio-17050.600-17055.400|I said, you know, I really meant it when I said you could come here.
audio-17057.300-17059.400|And I really meant it when I said I couldn't.
audio-17060.200-17064.000|Another silence and I felt myself moved toward crying.
audio-17064.700-17065.700|I pulled back.
audio-17065.500-17067.700|It wouldn't be right to cry.
audio-17067.500-17068.500|It wouldn't be fair.
audio-17068.300-17072.800|It would suggest I thought I was feeling more than he was when I knew I wasn't.
audio-17073.600-17075.500|It sort of reminds me of lemmings.
audio-17075.300-17080.000|He said what the idea of my going to Madison?

audio-17100.200-17108.200|I felt inpatient only Kilroy to turn a breakup conversation into a disquisition on suicidal rodents.
audio-17108.900-17119.600|I once knew someone who thought Lemmings were people he went on it was like he'd missed the part about them being too in long or whatever and only tuned in on the big run off the cliff.
audio-17120.600-17121.600|That's terrible.
audio-17121.400-17124.800|He said why doesn't someone try to stop them?
audio-17125.600-17130.300|He laughed and I joined in a little half-heartedly who was that?

audio-17294.300-17298.400|I still had to let myself into his apartment if he was already asleep.
audio-17298.200-17301.100|I'd undress quietly and get into bed with him.
audio-17300.900-17306.000|He's feel me smell my smell and then gradually wake to my return.

audio-17530.600-17539.900|I vaguely remember there being some stationary in the bottom drawer and when I opened it, I felt myself smile at the sight a box of Snoopy stationary.
audio-17539.700-17542.200|Jamie's given me for my birthday in third grade.
audio-17542.000-17548.200|I took a piece out and saw that there was only one more left and that someone had written on it.
audio-17548.000-17550.100|Happy birthday to you.
audio-17549.900-17551.300|Happy birthday to you.
audio-17551.100-17553.900|You look like a monkey and you smell like one too.
audio-17554.800-17557.000|I'm just kidding dear.
audio-17556.800-17557.500|Carrie.
audio-17557.300-17558.600|Happy birthday.
audio-17558.400-17562.000|You're my best friend love and kisses from Jamie.
audio-17562.700-17565.600|I sent the page of my desk and uncapped a pain.
audio-17565.400-17572.300|I sat there thinking for a long time and then I wrote this just under Jamie's loopy third grade signature.
audio-17573.100-17574.100|It's true.
audio-17573.900-17576.300|I smell like a monkey even to myself.
audio-17576.100-17581.300|Can I tell you one last time how sorry I am apologetic?
audio-17581.100-17585.100|Yes, but even more to the point, just sorry for what you've gone through.
audio-17584.900-17613.600|I used to imagine us growing old together or not growing old but being old sitting on the porch with some Nursing Home in matching rockers and reminiscing about our teen years even once I was was Mike, I never pictured anyone but the two of us and I didn't pick for a sick either just wrinkled and white haired and laughing about the time we tried to do our math homework by breaking potato chips into fractions and arranging them into equations on your bedroom floor.
audio-17614.600-17615.400|I'm back.
audio-17615.200-17618.900|For real and what I know is this Carrie.
audio-17618.700-17620.800|Mine is Jamie equals too much loss.
audio-17621.700-17626.700|I folded the page put it in a Snoopy envelope and walk back to the Fletchers.
audio-17626.500-17632.500|The barbecue smell was gone and I put the letter in the mailbox and walked home again in the sudden dark.
audio-17633.200-17635.500|My mother was in the kitchen when I arrived.
audio-17635.300-17643.800|I told her a little about the weekend at the mayor's neither of us had eaten and we made a big salad and carried our plates out onto the back porch.
audio-17644.700-17649.200|It was completely dark outside the circle of light cast by the dim porch fixture.
audio-17650.100-17653.300|Did you have a feeling he was going to leave I said?
audio-17654.100-17659.200|My father were there any hints or did it just happen out of the blue?
audio-17659.000-17661.900|She said her plate on the porch floor.
audio-17662.600-17667.700|I thought it was going to explode she said it last you mean do something violent.
audio-17667.500-17676.100|No, I mean I actually had a recurring image of his head literally exploding which was probably the closest I could come to wanting to kill him.
audio-17675.900-17683.400|So in answer to your question, I don't think I had a feeling he was going to leave but it didn't happen out of the blue either.
audio-17683.200-17687.900|He had a lot of momentum going I put my glass down.
audio-17688.800-17690.300|Will you horribly lonely?
audio-17690.100-17694.700|Not really more relieved hugely relieved.
audio-17694.500-17699.900|In fact, and of course really angry to I had you though and that's What mattered.
audio-17700.600-17711.900|I looked at my hands she'd had me but only until she hadn't I remembered all those dinners at the mayor's all those weekend afternoons thanksgivings.
audio-17711.700-17720.800|When I took her with Christmas is when I wanted to go but didn't I looked across the porch at her tot chin to still young Contours of her face.
audio-17720.600-17733.100|She had something in common with Kilroy the possibility of spending Christmas alone with nothing for company, but a big book and something else a kind of Stillness in the face of being left.
audio-17732.900-17740.100|She had friends she had her work but in some essential way the important thing had already happened to her.
audio-17740.900-17742.000|I was back.
audio-17741.800-17746.100|Yes, but I didn't ever want to feel that way that there was nothing new up ahead.
audio-17747.000-17748.100|Are you lonely now?
audio-17749.200-17753.300|She looked over at me my mother and her burgundy linen work dress.
audio-17753.100-17757.200|She shook her head lonely is a funny thing.
audio-17757.000-17758.900|She said slowly.
audio-17758.700-17765.200|It's almost like another person after while it'll keep you company if you let it.
audio-17768.500-17773.000|I sat at the dining room table the morning sun shining on to my sewing machine.
audio-17774.000-17776.600|It was a week since my conversation with Kilroy.
audio-17776.400-17784.400|I'd called a woman whose dress I'd altered and we met at Fabrications ride steered her to a lovely cornflower blue silk.
audio-17784.200-17787.200|I drawn her away from the dowdy shape.
audio-17787.000-17790.100|She wanted instead resurrecting the vision.
audio-17789.900-17793.300|I'd had weeks earlier when she picked up the red silk dress.
audio-17793.100-17797.800|I'd altered for her a boatneck top over a flared skirt.
audio-17797.600-17800.600|Just wait for her narrow shoulder tight.
audio-17800.400-17806.400|I'd had her by a couple of patterns, but I was using them more as a starting place than anything else.
audio-17806.200-17809.700|I had my experience at Parsons to help.
audio-17809.500-17815.000|Although I also felt that I'd left it behind a bright flag receding in the distance.
audio-17814.800-17819.800|I was working on the cutting line when the doorbell rang at a little after 11.
audio-17820.500-17827.900|Jamie was on the doorstep blond hair hanging by her face a pink tank top showing her pale shoulders.
audio-17827.700-17833.600|It would sound better to say we both burst into tears that we fell into each other's arms right there.
audio-17833.400-17846.100|But in fact it was very awkward the two of us with our arms folded across our chest standing outside and then standing in the kitchen and finally sitting down glasses of iced tea creme de Niro trembly hands.
audio-17845.900-17868.300|We talked in the way of two people with something enormous and impossible to speak of we talked about movies the weather a new CD she wondered if I'd heard gradually, I relaxed I realized we didn't have to say everything that morning or soon or ever She stayed for half an hour exactly as if she decided in advance.
audio-17869.400-17872.300|Standing to leave she asked if I'd like to come for dinner some night.
audio-17872.100-17874.300|We take turns cooking.
audio-17874.100-17879.200|She said I said I'd like to walking to the front door.
audio-17879.000-17887.800|I said are you going to stay home for a while she nodded how is she she came home for a visit last weekend.
audio-17887.600-17890.600|It was like having this very polite house guest.
audio-17891.500-17896.600|After Jamie left, I called Mike and suggested lunch and cleaned up the dining room and headed over.
audio-17896.400-17900.300|He was on the deck waiting tennis had firmly on his head.
audio-17900.100-17908.600|We've been eating a lot of ethnic food or is ethnic is it got in Madison enchiladas and Pad Thai today.
audio-17908.400-17917.800|He suggested the Union Terrace we drove over and I found an easy parking place right on Langdon graduation was over and summer school hadn't started yet.
audio-17917.600-17927.600|We went out to the lake and took the ramp up to the Terrace Mike waited at a shady table while I went inside for deli sandwiches back outside.
audio-17927.400-17930.400|I sat next to him both of us facing the lake.
audio-17931.100-17936.700|I put a straw in his iced tea and positioned it near the edge of the table so he could bend over for a drink.
audio-17937.600-17941.400|He swallowed and looked over at me there can an called yesterday.
audio-17941.200-17943.100|He said they could use some help.
audio-17942.900-17945.900|He said I could start with 20 hours a week and then see.
audio-17946.600-17959.400|Dirk Van with his old boss at the bank and I tried to contain my excitement might could go on and on about the uselessness of trying to be useful but I thought going back to the bank would be the best possible thing for him.
audio-17959.200-17962.800|Are you going to he made his face?
audio-17962.600-17964.900|I thought I'd never go back there.
audio-17964.700-17973.500|It's so out there meet the public but I realize the main thing I wouldn't be able to do is shake hands with people which doesn't matter.
audio-17973.300-17977.900|He looked at me something stirring way back behind his eyes.
audio-17977.700-17981.900|It does matter, but it's not the end of the world.
audio-17982.700-17988.600|I looked across the water and there was picnic point a finger of land pointing into the lake.
audio-17988.400-18000.200|I remember it's two story of walking across the ice with Mike and rooster and I imagine Mike out there as he took step after dangerous step in the drifting show of a December 9th.
audio-18000.900-18003.100|Mike took a deep breath in the inside.
audio-18004.200-18005.600|Can I ask you something?
audio-18005.400-18012.600|He said of course, he looked down and colored slightly then looked up again in his eyes met mine.
audio-18012.400-18014.600|Are you back to stay?
audio-18015.500-18023.700|Yes, I said but my throat felt funny and it came out horse and Scratchy hardly even a word I said it again.
audio-18023.500-18025.000|Yes.
audio-18025.800-18031.200|He smiled too complicated inward-looking a smile of Warring emotions quieted.
audio-18031.000-18032.700|It's only for the time being.
audio-18033.600-18036.400|So you're what's going to fly back for your car?
audio-18037.300-18041.700|I sold it I said he sucked in his cheek and nodded.
audio-18041.500-18043.800|Oh that makes sense.
audio-18043.600-18045.900|It must be hard to park in New York.
audio-18045.700-18047.600|I needed the money.
audio-18047.400-18050.800|You can imagine how expensive it is to live there.
audio-18050.600-18052.600|He scaled a little.
audio-18052.400-18054.100|Yes I can.
audio-18054.800-18063.900|I felt makes eyes on me and wondered what he could see if I had Kilroy was here written on me somewhere in a tiny hurried scrawl.
audio-18063.700-18065.600|Of course.
audio-18065.400-18072.100|I did just as Kilroy had Carrie was here on him or would stay whether he tried to rub it away or not.
audio-18071.900-18081.700|He was a map of messages read by no one I'd felt them with my fingertips, but they've been hieroglyphic in decipherable.
audio-18082.600-18092.900|My left hand was resting on the edge of the table and Mike looked down at it at my ring his ring power ring, which I've been wearing all this time.
audio-18093.500-18106.200|arise meant pocket if you want he said I would never I twisted the ring around my finger then took it off and put it on my right hand and held it out for him to see.
audio-18108.000-18109.400|It's a friendship ring.
audio-18109.200-18111.500|Now how that happened.
audio-18111.300-18114.400|It just did Presto change-o.
audio-18114.200-18117.600|I smiled at him the ring.
